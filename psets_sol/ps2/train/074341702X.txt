As a young woman I was appauled by Gurian's lack of respect forwomen as human beings.What makes me the most furious is hisshadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she isonly worth something if she squishes herself to allow theboys and men to take the lead in life.The resounding message isgirls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because ofour hormones make important contributions to society beyondtraditional roles.I don't remember ever being taken over byhormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primativechemical reactions he believes all females to be.I agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness.Gurianis a master at twisting words around and you have to read hisbooks being mindfull of his tricks.His book is full of agenda.
