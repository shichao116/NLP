If you haven't read The Good Fairies of New York, and especially if you are a New Yorker, or a New Yorker at heart, stop reading this right now, and immediately put your name on the Amazon.com pre-order list ... The Good Fairies have found their way back home to Amazon.com and to NYC, and everyone around the world is overly excited by the news!I have been addicted to Martin Millar for over ten years. I was one of the lucky few to have purchased a copy of The Good Fairies of New York before it became an out-of-print statistic.Martin has a talent for twisting the logic out of reality, and making you believe his tales are not mere inventions of his fragmented mind, but instead are actual events. The Good Fairies of New York will make you a believer, if not in fairies, at least in Martin's belief that they exist.The Good Fairies is not a child's fairytale, but instead a tale that includes fairies. Martin's forte is writing about characters that are flawed (some physically flawed, all emotionally flawed). Although Martin brings a refreshing childlike innocence in his approach of character development, his books are very adult orientated.He is not afraid to tackle serious subjects using a perverse sense of humor to lighten the mood when life becomes too grim. The Good Fairies will take you on an emotional ride that you will want to re-experience over and over.All of Martin's books should have the following label ... Caution: be forewarned that all it takes is one book to become a Martin Millar junkie
