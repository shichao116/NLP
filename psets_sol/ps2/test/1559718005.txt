Being from Minnesota and a lover of nature, the subject matter of this book intrigued me.  Having done photography as an advanced amateur most of my life, much of it in the same areas Jim shoots, I am completely awestruck  at his ability to capture such a sense of the northwoods with only one  frame a day.  Besides being a visually stunning work, it gives us  &quot;wannabes&quot; food for thought.  Maybe hunting that perfect frame  would help us capture the essence we want, instead of firing off a whole  roll of film.  Myself, I know that if I ever encounter a wolf in the wild  up close, I won't remember this advice but will take a whole roll, but  maybe after my first encounter, the next one will show thought, inspired by  this book
