I found Anne Perry almost 20 years ago (to the best of my memory), when her Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series was just beginning and the Monk series didn't exist yet. I have read them all, thoroughly enjoyed them all, but let's face it -- after more than 30 books set in roughly the same time period, some of them tend to feel a bit repetitive (to the point that I get confused when I go to buy the latest paperbacks).Not so "The Shifting Tide." I don't care what other reviewers here have said about unbelievable characters and historical inaccuracies; this is FICTION, and brilliantly drawn. You see the sights, feel the emotions, believe in the characters. In addition, you experience the concerns and perspectives of an entirely different era as if you were there (when was the last time you seriously tried to envision a plague epidemic?). Finally, the sweet parts are genuinely sweet, but when it's time to visit the dark side, it's a dark and nasty vision that sticks in your head after you close the book.In my opinion, this is by far Perry's best novel yet. I LOVED it and can't wait to see what she comes up with next
