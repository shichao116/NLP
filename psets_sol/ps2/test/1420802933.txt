I have a couple of habits loathed by purist bibliophiles--dog-earing pages and highlighting/annotating passages. This is one of those rare books in which the dog-earing ends up being virtually useless for review because it was a rare page that didn't have some thought or reference making a folded corner ostensibly worthwhile.While I agree with other reviewers that perhaps a condensed edition aimed at newcomers to the atheist worldview would be valuable, and that more concrete examples would benefit many sections, I find this volume, overall, to be a wonderfully cogent compendium of well-supported and well-justified thought and reason on an integrated atheist worldview.As a graphic designer, I must say the book's cover is downright cheesy. Granted I have a biased eye in this regard, but I actually found myself placing the book face-down between readings so as not to have to look at the front cover. Not only are Carrier's abilities as an artist vastly inferior to his powers as philosopher and writer, but also, the typography on the cover is depressingly amateurish and uninspiring. Worse, I have yet to fathom the link between the cover illustration (astronaut? space module on grass?) and the book's contents.  While I understand that "judging a book by its cover" is a proverbial no-no, it is clearly proven that most people do it, consciously or not. For a book as valuable as this one, I hate to think how many potential readers might pass on it because of its unsophisticated, almost childish cover design. It may be that, as the book is published by an online "vanity press," the design is left to the author or somehow generated by generic templates. Whatever the reasons for the bad design, "Sense and Goodness Without God" deserves far better, and 85% of my reasoning behind not giving it a full five stars was based on that opinion
