West's best-known and best novel runs barely longer than a longish short  story, yet it is so packed with detail, characterization and incident that  it has all the depth of a much longer book while keeping its scope limited  to the confines of a country home in rural England.  The reader finishes  the book (probably after one sitting) feeling as if he/she knows the four  major characters intimately, a testament to West's deft, succint, perfectly  molded prose.  There's not a false note, a misplaced line, a hollow emotion  to be found here--critical, since this is a novel nearly exploding with  suppressed emotion.  One feels deeply--and equally--for the wounded,  amnesiac soldier; his distraught young wife; his confused but optimistic  ex-girlfirend; and his cousin, the narrator, who harbors her own unrequited  love for the man.  It is exceedingly rare that any work of art achieves  perfection, but &quot;Return of the Soldier&quot; does.  Despite its  spareness and its limited focus, it is profound in its examination of the  human heart.  A must read
