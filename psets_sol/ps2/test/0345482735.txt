Volume 9 of Negima follows the pattern of "after a big battle, it's time for some mostly unknown student development." While half the volume is dedicated to the general group of magic/tech/martial arts friendly students that usually surround Negi (Chachamaru, Asuna, etc.), the new students to get their own focus are the chef Yotsuba, the ghost Aisaka, and renaissance girl Chao Lingshen...Various ruckus (rucki? ruckeses?) are planted throughout with plenty of opportunity for fanservice, such as the lovely cosplay section towards the beginning (mmm... bunny girl Setsuna)... not to mention that Negi (er, Nagi?) and Asuna actually go on a date together!Akamatsu's art is great, as always, and his penchant for having very busy frames carries through with little tidbits of insight and comedy. And, while the progression is, also as always, cliche and stereotypical, he still manages to sneak a few goodies in that can make a reader see past the shallow fun of the festivities to the big picture Akamatsu's trying to paint adventure-wise for the entire title.All in all, a fun read with more than a few possible red herrings/hints to the grand arc and jokes (nun's who are witches?).
