Like another reviewer, my interest in history is quite new. The author's presentation of John Adams left me wanting to know much more of this great man. David McCullough's excerpting of Adams' professional and personal writings exposed a passionate man of deep convictions and possessed of an intellect and idealism beyond his generation. While Mr. Adams was acutely aware of and deplored his own ego, he, at the same time was critical of his own limitations. Even with this conflict, Adams could still say, "I thank God that he gave me stubborness when I am right."While I read history for breadth of understanding and perspective; learning the character, strengths, weaknesses and foibles of great men and women who accomplished much during their time on the stage challenges me to dare more and risk more in the time and place God has entrusted to me.I would very much liked to have met John Adams
