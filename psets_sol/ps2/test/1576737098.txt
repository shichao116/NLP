Out of the many Christian books I have read, Boy Meets Girl has been the most resourceful, although the others do give some pointers and good advice. Joshua Harris takes relationships to a level of courtship which is the most logical level for Christians seeking a relationship. Boy Meets Girl realistically defines and provides detailed examples of courtships. Harris completely outlines the model of a courtship and provides steps achieve a courtship. I highly recommend this book if you are tired of dating or if you are ready to begin a relationship that purposefully explores the possiblity of marriage
