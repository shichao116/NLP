If in the contemporary literature there are so many writers dealing with the magical realism, we must be grateful to Juan Rulfo and his masterpiece "Pedro Paramo" that brought this kind of narrative to us. The experience of reading this short book can be very difficult to most of us at first, but, once we get used to the magical ideas and the writer's style the narrative flows smoothly.Juan Preciado returns to a town called Comala, a place his mother left when he was just a baby. That is literally a ghost town -- there are many dead walking people. On arriving there he finds out that his father, a landlord, was a tyrant and people didn't like him. Preciado is taken by some spirits and guide through the story of the city and its death, brought on by Paramo.Evil and chaos arise from Paramo's hand in the story. That's why Comala has been destroyed. In the early days, the landlord, with the assistance of the church, leads the whole town to corruption, philandering and decay. As a consequence violence suffuses the city. Miguel, Paramo's son, is the personification of that. He is a serial rapist and ends up killed by his horse. When Susana, Pedro's love interest dies, he shuts the entire city down mandating that the farm become dead and funding revolutionaries.For most, what maked "Pedro Paramo" a difficult book is the style of narrative chosen by Rulfo. His text reads like the hopscotch. Narrative swifts time and place easily -- and to understand the changes and new narratives, the reading of this novel requires double attention. The story can jump which jumps between Juan's dealings with the residential ghosts of the town, his channeling of the non-ghost souls those departed who exist in a mental limbo, and non-linear retelling or straight narration of the past.In his narrative, the author is dealing with the tragedy -- in an experienced level rather than in a viewed level.  The effect intended by the writer is a simple one -- with that he brings his readers closer to his narrative. Contemporary authors try to dead with that, but not many are as successful as Rulfo -- one of the best positive examples is Gabriel Garcia Marquez that with charm and style mastered his own narrative having with basis Rulfo's proposition."Pedro Paramo" is a highly recommended book. It is difficult and interesting. But don't let the size fool you. It is short but complex and profound -- and, for many people, disturbing.
