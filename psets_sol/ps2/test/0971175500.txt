I do some work for Larry Crane and was very impressed when I read this, his first book.  I had already taken the Abundance Course on tape and received this book compliments of Larry at his Mo-Ranch Abundance & Bliss Retreat (we all got one).  I figured it would be great for when I couldn't listen to the tapes and it is great.  I find it to be an amazing support.  Each page I read, I find myself releasing more and more.  I usually read a page, stop for about ten minutes to do some releasing, and then read the next page and do more releasing.This is not a book I tend to read cover-to-cover, but rather I trust my intuition to have me open to the page I most need at that moment, and it is always the perfect page for what I most need to release on.I'm not sure how it would be as a standalone book, without having first taken the course on CD/tape or a live class, but it does cover everything taught in the audio version and most of what's in the live classes except for certain group exercises.  I guess it would boil down to learning style and preference.  I propably would not have gotten as much from it if I had simply read the book first, as I learn better by having someone walk me through an exercise, instead of self-guiding myself through it as I read a little, then try it, read a little, then try it, etc.  Now that I know how to release, the book is more a terrific reminder on subjects I should release more on.This book---while in my opinion is not a substitute for the audio CDs or a live class---does teach the entire Release Technique method as originally discovered by Lester Levenson, and is therefore, in my estimation, priceless.  One of Lester's books, "Keys to the Ultimate Freedom" has sold for as much as $795 on Amazon.  If you find it in the $200 range, grab it!  Or, get "The Ultimate Truth" book, which is a nice summary of the most important topics Lester covered in the "Keys" book.Enjoy.  And, if your learning style is like mine, I would encourage you to follow-up or precede the book with either the audio course or a live class.  Then the book will be a fantastic adjuct to take your releasing up to a new level and will be a great companion on planes, trains or in the park---wherever you find you like to read and relax.By the way, if you get it at ReleaseTechnique.com/abundance, it comes with a 30-day money back guarantee, so if it's not what you expected, you can return it.  Not sure on the Amazon policy for used books.In conclusion, no one, including Larry, asked me to write a review for this book.  I noticed it didn't have one and thought it a shame for such a great book to not have anything written about it.  It's a real keeper, which I greatly value.  I have hundreds of books in my library, but few that I actually return to.  I have returned to this book many, many times and always get more from it.  It gets me high as a kite very quickly
