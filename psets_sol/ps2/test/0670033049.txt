East of Eden is truly a novel of unfound proportions. It plays on the juxtaposition of naivety and wisdom, truth and faith, struggle and redemption, and most importantly, good and evil. Within the given boundaries of 600 pages, Steinbeck explores the psychological and mental desires of everybody, while also enlightening the readers with a theory on the purpose of life and its attributes.The main storyline follows the vicious cycle of two generations of siblings in the Trask family, while also playing on the biblical reference to the stories of Cain and Abel, and Caleb and Aron. The two set of brothers, who set the stage for the novel, are always in conflict with one another in their desire to gain the love of their fathers. In its exploration of their interaction with the people around them and with their fathers, Steinbeck uses the brothers in order to explain life as the Bible does. He directly calls upon the stories in the vastly popular book in order to expound on God's meaning of life as it pertains to society and how people should view their lives in respect to others. He creates a whole commonalty of characters that help extenuate and expose the interactions of people and their effects. Cathy, another important figure in the book, is Steinbeck's way of placing evil in a light that takes a tangible form. Cathy is one character alone that while she amazes and builds suspense for the reader, she also disgusts and shocks the reader with her cunning ability to manipulate people at the lift of a finger. Her evil genius is solely a product of her desires: to get out of work in dismissing responsibility, to subjugate blame, and gain an enormous control over people. Steinbeck also delves into the meaning of life and how it is defined completely on the ability of choice. He acquaints the readers with the word "timshel." Etymologically speaking, the Hebrew word directly translates to "thou mayest," which Steinbeck uses to express his viewpoint on choice. He tells the reader that only he has the ability to choose the path of his life, and it is he who can conquer sin and break from past trends.Ultimately, the book brings out the true battle of good and evil as the Bible interprets it, and reveals the true definition of life. As Steinbeck explores the issues that surround life in terms of faith, trust, and love, he creates an unbelievable book, despite its licentiousness, that leaps out of the boundaries delineated by society. The characters, the themes, the story itself, all of it comes together, creating a momentous book by all standards
