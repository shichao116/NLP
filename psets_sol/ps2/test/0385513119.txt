This is an interesting book to see a good historian's view of what happened in the ancient persian country and areas around;  and it is interesting and lively to read, keeps you awake!!!  Makes you realize what they accomplished by brute force!!!  I'm sure way too many people think it OK to master by brute force; therein lies the conundrum!!  But it has been endemic to many past civilizations and I hope we can get beyond all this kind of history and live in peace and join the cosmic societies whom we are told do live in peace. . . . anyway, some great history here!!
