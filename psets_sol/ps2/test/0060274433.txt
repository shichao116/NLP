Interesting comments (below) about this book, BUT I have to say that we didn't even notice the fact that the equations and the sequence of the numbers didn't match until I read the reviews here.In any case, let me give you our viewpoints on the book.First the equations covered:3 + 2 = 56 + 1 = 74 + 4 = 87 + 3 = 109 + 0 = 9Now, with only 5 equations you won't be producing a math whiz, but what you can do is introduce the idea of equations and addition to children.Personally I am using this book with my preschooler (boy-4 yo).  [It is too limited in scope for my 6 yo Kindergarten age daughter.]  We count the animals and I ask him to read the equation, and he IS grasping the basic idea of addition and formulas.  The way that the equation is shown with pictures of the animals right above the animals helps a lot in getting this across.Four Stars.  Colorful bright book that addresses simple equations in a manner that (some) preschoolers and most older children can readily understand.  The concept is interesting to children and done in a way that makes sense to them.
