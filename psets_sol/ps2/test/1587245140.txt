The reader is confronted with a rather wimpy Democrat President who had the good sense to bring in as an Advisor Mitch Rapp, a real all-star hero. The book starts off with an ill fated attempt by a Navy Seal team to rescue an American family being held by the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas. The enemy was tipped off by a corrupt Philippine general. The Seals were ambushed. Rapp comes into the picture and carries out a successful rescue operation that dispenses with the general. The story then shifts to the middle-east (Israel,Palestine, Saudi's). A somewhat sympathetic character is the Palestinian terrorist David who orchestrates some very clever plots. Irene Kennedy, the CIA Director is fighting the good battle. Rapp's wife, a tv reporter is a bit too much. It's hard to imagine a guy like Mitch Rapp going for her. Anyway,it's a fairly good read.
