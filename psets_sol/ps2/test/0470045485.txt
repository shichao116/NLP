"Gentlemen, thanks a lot for keeping me up all night! I ordered off of Joe's first email Monday and then downloaded the bonuses. After listening to Dr. Len I went immediately into a meditative mode and that may be why Amazon delivered the book a day early. So now I will write this testimonial and go take a nap! As an old Chef, this is a great "cook book"  Superb tips on organization of the time spent together, I am intrigued with using a webcam to allow players from around the world to form a group.   Remembering to turn off the robots, so important. This book is the perfect "Roberts Rules of Order" parallel for creating, and monitoring a MM so that it serves its most valuable purpose; positive powerful growth for each member of the group. It will be the guide for many new successful alliances in the future. I will be sure anyone I form an alliance with has read a copy first! You and your contributors are to be commended for putting together a great guide to show why, and how these groups can be the incubator for great projects, be they for economic or other gain. It has been my experience that you want diversity and strong folk who can give and take and recognize how to utilize the power of constructive criticism to it's best advantage. I will use this one, and so will thousands of others. Congratulations on a job well done and feel free to share these thoughts.  Now for that nap
