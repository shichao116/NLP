I have enjoyed all of Kathy Reichs books, but her first book is still her best.  This book introduced me to a character I have grown very fond of, and look forward to each novel she has put out since.  I recommend them all highly.  I actually tried to read Patricia Cornwell after reading Ms. Reichs' books, but found them not quite as enjoyable.  The only book I do not recommend of the Temperance Brennan novels is the one written by Max Allan Collins, Bone Buried Deep, in which he has "borrowed" the Temperance Brennan character.  It is poorly written, and poorly researched
