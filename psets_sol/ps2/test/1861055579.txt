Balanced, straightforward biography of Hollywood's favorite leading man of the 1950's. The fact that he was both gay and promiscuous meant endless headaches for Hudson and his career managers during that most repressed of decades. The tension between big libido and big box-office underlay the actor's entire career, which author Bret tracks  in pretty unsparing terms from early fan mags to coverup marriage to final tragic outing. The emerging portrait is generally favorable, particularly that of a generous on-screen professional, who at the same time could be a fickle and sometimes ungenerous lover off-screen. Names are named and there is a gossipy dimension for the curious. But  the intimations remain pretty forthright without becoming catty or distasteful. Bret has handled this difficult but necessary aspect with understandable sensitivity. Still and all, he fails to clear up that murky veil drawn around Hudson's marriage to studio secretary Phyllis Gates, or the exact nature of his relationship with the controversial Marc Christian. So readers looking for resolution of these troubled phases of Hudson's personal life may be disappointed. My one real misgiving is with the plot synopses of Hudson's many films, big and small. Their inclusion in the text interrupts the flow and serves no discernable purpose other than padding the book's length (not that it needs padding). I found myself skipping entire pages as a result. Anyway, the biography comes across as an honest attempt to deal with the conflicted life of a movie legend, who, for better or worse, symbolizes an entire entertainment era.
