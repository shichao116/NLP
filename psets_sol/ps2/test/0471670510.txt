If you want to understand and apply persuasion principles and tools, study both this book by Hogan and Cialdini's "Influence." Cialdini's groundbreaking work explains six principles of persuasion that we all need to understand.In "The Science of Influence," Hogan expands the analysis of persuasion to ten laws of human behavior. And he shows you how to use these laws effectively. That's just one chapter!The other 11 chapters give you additional persuasion models and tools you can use now. You'll find this tightly written book both practical and fascinating. I especially like the chapter on reducing resistance. And Hogan, a master of framing, teaches that powerful skill in another chapter.Overall, you'll learn to apply the most current research to persuade others in ethical ways. This creates both short-term results and win-win relationships for long-term success.
