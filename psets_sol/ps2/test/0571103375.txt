On many levels, this is one of the most revealing books I have ever read. Regarding transsexualism, it reveals that as different we may be as people, much of the journey that we share is not unique.   Some may be put off a bit by the command of the English language that Miss Morris exhibits, but I found this to be a profound statement about the poor quality of education that we recieve today. Having attended private schools through High School, and having attended varioius colleges, I still found myself referring to the dictionary on numerous occasions. I do not attribute this to an attempt at showmanship on the part of Miss Morris, but to a decline in the past decades of real education.   Regarding the concept of femininity and womanhood described in this book, I would think that modern women of any sort may be offended. I remind the readers to remember the time, culture, and place in which Miss Morris comes of age. She experienced life in a culture which for the most part, no longer exists.   Thank you, Miss Morris, for paving the way, and opening my eyes
