When I think "encylopedia" I think entire sets or series of books. This is more like a dictionary of sexual practices.  There is an attempt to provide context, historical and contemporary, but not always as fully  or as clearly as you might like.  Why is it "unusual"?  Because a wide range of sexual activities and interests are covered that may not be strange to you or in your society but which could be rare or taboo for others.  There is a good index so you can find things fairly easily and it is fun to read.  Overall you come away knowing that the weird thing you did last night, really isn't all that weird
