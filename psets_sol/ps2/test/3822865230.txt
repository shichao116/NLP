This is an excellent entry in the Taschen series of art books. The author is a Professor of Art History at the University of Munster, Germany. The book deals mostly with still life paintings done by German and Dutch artists during the 1500's and 1600's. What I especially enjoyed was that  the book is broken down into sections describing the many different types  of still lifes done within the genre. For example, there are chapters on  kitchen scenes; game still lifes (deer and stags, etc. not Nintendo!);  musical instruments; weapons; books, etc. I read a lot of art books, but I  had no idea there were so many different types of still life paintings! Mr.  Schneider gives you the &quot;codes&quot; to decipher what the objects in a  still life mean. For example, in religious still lifes grapes and glasses  of wine and loaves of bread represent the eucharist. Many people know that,  but there are other, less obvious, examples. A mouse, for example, can  represent evil and butterflies can represent resurrection. Mr.Schneider  also explains how cultural and economic factors tie in to objects shown in  other still lifes. For example, some kitchen scenes are filled to the brim  with all sorts of food and may be shown to represent the wealth of the  patron or just to show the bountiful supply of food created by improved  agricultural methods or even to be a warning against gluttony! This book is  full of beautiful color plates and Mr. Schneider writes in a reader  friendly manner, blissfully free of art world jargon. I felt that  considering the quality of the paper and of the reproductions that the  price was very reasonable, too. Thumbs up
