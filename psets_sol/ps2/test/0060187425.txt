Ms. Due does not belong under the banner of a "horror" writer. She incorportes realism, with myticism, the supernatural, but not horror.  The people live very real lives, but have some quirks about them.  Ms. Due write fiction with depth. She makes you think, and is an excellent, imaginative storyteller.I feel like David and Jessica are members of my family.  Every sistah needs a David/Dawit, of course, minus his indiscretions and personality deficits.  If you are looking for a great love story, thrown in for good measure, murder, secrets, suspense, and the unbelievable, why My Soul to Keep is for you.I love this author.
