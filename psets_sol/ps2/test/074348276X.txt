This was one of my favorite Shakespeare tragedies because despite Lear bringing the misfortune on himself, the reader truly does feel for sorry for him.  When Cordelia could not declare her love to Lear like her sisters did, he takes this as a lack of love for him.  Of course it wasn't, but Lear's desperate neccesity for admiration from those around eventually becomes his downfall.While all of that action is going on, Gloucester's illegitimate son, Edmund is on the rise to power, hoping to overtake his brother.  King Lear is obviously a tragedy, but there is one aspect of it at the end that is truly rewarding to the reader.  Though none of Shakespeare's plays are, read this one and you definetly won't be dissapointed
