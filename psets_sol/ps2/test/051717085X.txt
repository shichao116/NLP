Before reading Songs My Mother Taught Me, I recommend printing out a copy of Brando's filmography from imdb.com and then watch as many of his films that you can find.  This will help you enjoy the book, because Brando assumes the reader has watched the films he talks about.  I watched most of his movies and became a fan.As many other reviewers stated, this book is an easy read.  I felt as if he was in the room with me telling his story.  Brando's life is a fascinating journey.  His philosophy on various topics can leave the reader with mixed emotions.  I left the book a lot more curious than I did going into it.  I wonder if his facts about HUAC, Isreal, and the Native American are true.  My future project is to seek out the information and decide for myself.  Unlike many of today's celebrites, he doesn't come across as arrogant or pretentious.  He had that reputation, but the book suggests otherwise.  Brando is humble about his talent, his role in various causes he joined, and his place in Hollywood as one of the greatest actors.Any aspiring actor should read this book.  Brando advocates the 'Method', which includes bringing your life experiences and incorporating them into the role you are playing.  In the same breath, he tells the reader not to overresearch the role as he did at times.  Later on in his career, he admits to 'winging it', because summoning up strong emotions are taxing when you get older.I respect his choice to leave his family and marriages out of his book.  It really isn't necessary.  I get the sense that his experiences with women haven't embittered him by the time he wrote the book, but he does admit to spending a large portion of his life as an angry man.Brando considering acting a means to an end.  That's all.  In his words, the hours are good, the pay great, and you only have to work three months out of the year.  I respect the fact that he didn't get sucked into the whole 'Hollywood' scene.  He explains why he refused the Best Actor Award for The Godfather.  His reasons make perfect sense, even if you don't agree with them.I highly recommend this book.  If you can find it new, buy it.  It's worth the money.  Brando's viewpoint isn't definitive, but you can get a better understanding of a man who in many ways is still a mystery.  He's someone I would've like to have met.  I envy people like Edward Norton and Johnny Depp, two actors around my age, who had a chance to work with him
