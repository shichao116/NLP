My review will reflect the readability of this book - simple. I highly recommend this book to a person (like me) that is new to &quot;management&quot;. I'm sure others can find it useful as well, but there were some simple mistakes that I had been making that were quickly corected after reading this book. It is so inexpesive, but do not mistake that &quot;low price must equal low content&quot;...that wasn't the case at all. As this text points out...the worst mistake you can make is to run an &quot;unprofitable&quot; business. If you are running a profitable business in this economy you are probably doing a lot of things right! I actually loaned this book to a peer and he hadn't returned it yet, so I am getting another copy so I can go back to it when needed
