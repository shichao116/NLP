My daughter received this book and a Tinker Bell doll for her fifth birthday and it was a major hit.  The illustrations are beautiful and the individual character details are delightful.  My daughter loves to read about each of the five fairies featured and then open each coordinating section to a poster size view of the individual fairies' "rooms" in the Home Tree (where fairies live in Pixie Hollow). Since then, we have purchased several other fairy books as she enjoys the character development.  This is a solid investment for any little girl who believes in magic.
