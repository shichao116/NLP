This is a great cookbook with a lot of nice photos.  I purchased this cookbook but had to return it due to the small font sizes used in the latest edition.  I had difficulty reading the ingredients when standing and the book is placed on the kitchen table.  I purchased the older edition instead.  It has a larger font and the price was much cheaper.  I compared 4 recipes from the 2 editions and noticed all the ingredients were the same.
