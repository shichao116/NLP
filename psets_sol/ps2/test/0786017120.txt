Scott Nicholson is an authority on Appalachian folklore, and his ambitious new novel, The Farm, is based on the primitive religion of the early Scots/Irish settlers in the region.  Not since The Amityville Horror has a haunted house story been so darkly intense, so ominously atmospheric.  Nicholson adds layer upon layer of complexity as the story builds toward its prolonged and amazing conclusion.When Katy's marriage ended with Mark Draper, a well meaning but workaholic husband and father with a drug problem, she wanted to make a fresh start with their eleven-year-old daughter, Jessica ("Jett"), who had also begun experimenting with drugs.  She met Gordon Smith, a professor of comparative religions, specializing in the primitive religions of the people of rural Appalachia, and although Gordon was somewhat cold and aloof and a bit pompous, he offered the stability she and Jett needed in their lives.  Despite the fact that she was not in love with him, Katy agreed to a hasty marriage, and the three of them moved into his old family farmhouse in the tiny town of Solom, North Carolina.As attractive as the move from the big city had seemed at the time, life in Solom was far from idyllic.  Gordon grew ever more emotionally withdrawn and his attitude toward Jett, one of sullen tolerance at best, deteriorated even further.But Katy had problems of her own.  The scent of lilacs kept occurring in the house, she heard whispering or footsteps when she was home alone, and items mysteriously fell off the pantry shelves and broke.  Katy became more and more obsessed with Gordon's dead wife, trying her recipes and even wearing her dresses.As Katy lost touch with herself and fell further under Rebecca's spell, Jett found herself on her own, facing dangers not even the evils of the city had held, including a menacing scarecrow that seemed to come to life, and goats that were not only drawn to the scent of blood but had a taste for flesh as well.Most bizarre of all was Gordon's ancestor, Harmon Smith, a Methodist preacher who settled in Solom two hundred years ago.  Harmon was a circuit rider, traveling by horseback from village to village to preach the Gospel.  Envied by the other local preachers, real trouble started when he abandoned the Methodist teachings and reverted to the pagan religion of the Old Country.  When he began offering sacrifices to the goddess of fertility, his crops and animals flourished, but so did the hatred toward him by the leaders of the other religious sects.  Legend had it that three of them ambushed and murdered him on a desolate mountain pass and buried parts of his body in three different graves.  But Harmon was not finished with Solom.  He returned periodically to claim a new sacrifice.  Yet as dreadful as the Circuit Rider may be, even darker powers may be at work here.The Farm is a complex and suspenseful tale, the characters are strong and convincing, the writing is tight, and Nicholson handles this long and elaborate story with a masterful touch.He does make the mistake of calling the Celtic deities by the names of their Greek counterparts, and the story has one or two other minor inconsistencies, but these things do not greatly distract from the story as a whole.Scott Nicholson is the author of The Harvest, The Manor, The Home, and the Stoker Award finalist The Red Church.  The Farm, Nicholson's finest work to date, is a gripping nightmare of a tale.  Highly recommended.
