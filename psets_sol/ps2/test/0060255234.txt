A friend read this book to my 5 year old roughian.  He loves books, but usually about dinos, animals etc, as his favorites. He loved this book!  After she told me about it, I got it from the library for him and he wanted me to read it to him several nights, looking and listening intently. It really is a surreal and beautiful story
