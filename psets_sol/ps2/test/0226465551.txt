It's quite amazing to how much length monopolists of all kinds will go to defend their position, even after they've been proven utterly wrong!The horrible, stupid and disasterous consequences of government interference in market processes should not require further demonstration, but here we go: yet another idiot who tries to prove that "markets are wrong".Kuttner doesn't get it: markets are OUTCOMES of incredibly large number of choices millions of people make. To say that some outcomes (momentary snapshots of ongoing, complex processes) is not "perfect" or "desirable", he argues from HIS personal perspective. Maybe indeed HE would have liked to allocate ressources differently, but it is the outcome of billions of individual decisions.The implicite assumption by Kuttner is that some "central agency" would know better. WRONG! As history teaches, any attempt at centralizing decision making FAIL, precisely because of limited knowlege and the complexity of any real problem.Let's take the example discussed elsewhere on this forum: airline deregulation. Apparently, there are many "negative consequences" and somehow, Kuttner doesn't like the current system very much. Well, that's HIS take. I assume he always was rich enough to pay excessively high air fares, contrary to the majority of people, who can only afford flights since the industry has been deregulated.Some companies fail. SO WHAT? That's part of the market process!!! Some companies provide bad seats, lousy service and have a slightly higher accident risk. SO WHAT? That's the point about a market: you are allowed to choose a really cheap, crappy solution. You're not FORCED to spend huge amounts of money, when all you want is to get cheaply from point A to point B! If you are WILLING to pay more - up to the ridiculous price levels from before deregulation, then you probably get a very high level of quality and service.As usual, Kuttner simply forgets about the fact that lousy quality is often the only way of making certain goods and services available to the not-yet-wealthy. Our grand-parents had to put up with things of incredibly shabby quality, as compared to what we have now. No one served up high quality on a silver platter at low cost.Worst of all is that a HUGE number of examples of "bad markets" actually are due to "bad regulations", but it takes brains to spot the unintended consequences of regulations, if all you ever read is the declaration of intent of any law.
