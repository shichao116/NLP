I heard Robert Mayer being interviewed on a local Chicago radio station and knew that his book was perfect for me.  I learned that even though I can't control conflict that may arise in my life, I can control how I will react to it.  I learned that mastering how I will react comes from a "still center" methodology.  It is something I apply every day in my life at work and at home.The book also reminded me that what makes good sense for me doesn't necessarily mean that it will make good sense for others.  That for me to influence how others make decisions, I have to understand what they are thinking and what their influences are.  That I have to understand and deal with their reality which may, and often is, very different than my own.Yes, much of what is in the book I already knew, but the book reminds me to use what I already knew and provides the necessary framework so that what "I already knew" will be used and put into play.How To Win Any Argument is filled with great advice (the chapter on persuasive writing should be compulsory reading for everyone who advocates a position) and I'm highly recommending this book to anyone who has to deal with conflict.  It's a definite 10 star book.  Too bad Amazon's reviews only go to five stars
