The good thing about this book is that I know that Robin Fisher Roffer does actually work in the branding space and she works with some big companies. So it's a far cry from a bogus self-help book that some of these other tooting horns and walking in front of the parade (no offense if your book includes those words) often portend to offer. In the first couple of chapters she suggests you fill out some forms and begin to package your personal brand strategy. The only thing I wish is that she had used REAL people rather than "Mary Beth" Or "Jillian" who are either composites or made-up characters. Her chapter 5 about recruiting a squad of brand cheerleaders goes along with my advice in my SUCCESSFUL RECAREERING book to create a personal board of advisors....NO INDEX makes me sad -- because I really think that people who are on a quest (potential readers of this kind of book) want an index to check out and refer back to. Some references to a page in your planner type of thing date this a bit for any Gen X or Gen Y user who is heading to social networking sites like Myspace.com or Youtube.com for their videos and bios and brand building. What a difference six years makes...could be a lifetime in Internet Years in the new Digital Economy. Looking forward to meeting the author some day -- and seeing what she says about updating some of the goodies in here.
