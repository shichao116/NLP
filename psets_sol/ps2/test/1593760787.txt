Dear Mr. Berry,I don't know if you will ever see this, but it is the only way I know of letting you know how much your stories mean to me.  I read your books with a highlighter, as there are just too many meaningful passages not to be marked and referenced over and over again.  You certainly have a gift for words.  The melodious nature of your writing is as addicting as is anything else I have ever experienced.  The stories you tell and retell about the citizens of Port William, are for me lessons of a sort.  For those of us who sometime wonder what love is, what kindness means, and what it means to be part of something greater than self-serving interests, well, you provide an extraordinary example in your wonderful work.Thank you so much, for the pleasure I get when I read what you have written
