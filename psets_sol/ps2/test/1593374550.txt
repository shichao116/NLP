Elizabeth Cogswell Baskin has written an entertaining, useful book about launching and operating a business "like a girl." Actually, her book is filled with grown-up practical advice that women and men (as opposed to girls and boys) can use, though she hews to her gender-difference theme, particularly pointing out that women tend to rely more on intuition and relationship-building. She covers getting started, choosing your partner, opening your office, surviving slow times and marketing your product. Baskin recounts the stories of female sojourners in the entrepreneurial world and gives more than a third of the book to informative Q&A interviews with women business owners. If you seek a scholarly dissertation about how (or whether) women and men operate businesses differently, we suggest you look elsewhere. But, if you're looking for a fun read that feels like you're at a long lunch dishing with your more knowledgeable pals about getting your business going, then this is the book for you
