The Nazi-Soviet War may finally be getting its due in western military history. For decades theaters of secondary and tertiary importance have received the lion's share of attention in English-language literature. For example, the comparative sideshow in North Africa held the advantage because half the armies involved were  British/Commonwealth or American, sources in English were readily available, familiar and flamboyant personalities like Rommel and Churchill were involved, the fighting was episodic, orderly and easy to follow (like American baseball), absence of murderous Nazi racial and occupation policies there allowed study without forcing a moral stance, etc. Except for the part about flamboyant personalities, the Nazi-Soviet War possessed none of these features.Historiography of that theater has passed through numerous "generations." First came the German memoirs; after all, no one else in the west knew much about that war. Then followed the standard general works by authors like John Erickson and Earl Ziemke; they overturned the earlier bias that only Soviet hordes led by unschooled generals stood between Germany and victory.David Glantz, a retired US Army colonel, has been at the forefront of a new generation. Especially after the collapse of the USSR he has seemingly been on a one-man mission to mine ex-Soviet/Russian archives and sources and bring them to light for the western historian interested in WW II's penultimate theater. However, until recently his works have been limited to a specific place and time during the Nazi-Soviet War. These earlier works were also usually extremely detailed, technical and not at all edited for the general military-history reader. The only previous exception to this trend was his _When Titans Clashed_, co-written with Jonathan House, an overview of the entire four-year struggle.Glantz's _Before Stalingrad_ is a re-issued paperback version of his hardcover and large format _Barbarossa_, published in 2001. Both books cover the fighting in 1941: Hitler's invasion on 22 June through Stalin's counter-offensives that December. They are more accessible and are written and edited for a more general audience than the bulk of Glantz's catalog, possibly in this case mainly serious military historians and students of WW II in particular. However, _Before Stalingrad_ could serve as one's first book on Operation Barbarossa without losing the reader in minutia.Both books begin with a background chapter on armies, equipment, plans and doctrine. Glantz then breaks down the fighting according to major operations and, where appropriate, strategic machinations in the headquarters of both dictators. Although in hindsight we know the Nazis did not conquer Moscow, Glantz keeps the issue in doubt until near the end. Both contain scholarship of a high order, complete with helpful and thorough endnotes (although personally I prefer footnotes). Errors are so minor and so few that they don't deserve further mention. Appendices include "usual suspects" of Fuehrer Directives plus some Soviet planning documents and an excellent order of battle of forces arrayed on Barbarossatag.Glantz does not skimp on analysis, either. At the end of each chapter are his "Reflections" and the book closes with a strong concluding chapter. He deals with Barbarossa's greatest controversy by stating that in late summer the Germans had little choice other than to deal with the Soviet threat around Kiev before turning on Moscow (Hitler knew such was the case months before the campaign began). He places fault for the campaign's ultimate failure on German strategic (and logistic) overstretch plus Soviet recuperative powers and climbing learning curve. Operationally we witness Barbarossa's death by a thousand cuts. With fewer that 200 pages of actual narrative, however, one will find almost no mention of tactical engagements.One regrets Glantz did not add a new forward or preface to _Before Stalingrad_ to update the reader on recent scholarship since the publication of _Barbarossa_. For some reason, the publisher assembled all maps in one section near the end of the book instead of spacing them throughout as in the earlier effort. The maps are greatly improved over those in Glantz's Frank Cass and self-published works (although much smaller in the paperback volume) but I believe the massive campaign deserves more of them. Bottom Line: either book is a "must have" for the serious student of Operation Barbarossa.
