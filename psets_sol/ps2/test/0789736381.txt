I've read about 80% of the book with the other 20% not having anything to do with what I need Quicken to do (investments).  The book is filled with graphical pictures and the chapters are laid out nicely.....just like the help file.The book is geared for beginners in COMPUTERS, not Quicken.  I know how to use menus to execute commands.  This book successfully shows beginners how to "click cashflows" or "search".  However, I would think that most who would purchase Quicken would already know the basics.Also, there is regrettably no information about how to link the tax forms to new items that you've created.  Moreover, there is no information with respect to problems downloading transactions from your institution or credit card.  Currently, I am "correctly" setup to download both from my bank and from my credit card.My bank sometimes doesn't properly login automatically using auto-update, but does login automatically when I click the Update Now button manually (without providing any additional credentials).  My credit card downloads are strange...they always download the transactions, but most of the transactions show up as either duplicates or triplicates.  This wreaks havoc on the Cash Flows page and there is no information in this book to troubleshoot any of those problems whatsoever.I've recently read most the help file and cannot find any glaring differences with what is in this book.  The book provides nice pictures, but doesn't EXPLAIN anything...just says "to search, click search" etc.I've rated it 2 stars because of it's lack of differentiation from the help file and because I blew $25 on a "help file with pictures".  I am disappointed in this book
