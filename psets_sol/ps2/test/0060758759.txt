"Selma Koch, a Manhattan store owner who earned a national reputation by helping women find the right bra size, mostly through a discerning glance and never with a tape measure, died Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 95 and a 34B."It may take especially thick skin to find a book on the subject of obituaries anything but depressing and morbid, but for those like me who are pre-disposed to finding such things more entertaining and fascinating than frightening this is an appealing topic. Then again, I'm native to the Deep South, where people go on death watch the minute you pick up the phone to make an appointment for a medical check up.
