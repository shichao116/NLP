Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527)wrote THE PRINCE as a "how to" book.  While this book was written in Renaissance Italy, THE PRINCE is a timely classic of political thought that has been badly distorted by shallow media men and historians too cowardly to carefully examine political reality.Machiavelli wrote THE PRINCE in an attempt regain political position, and he offered good practical advice to his "patron" or anyone else who had interest in political power.  Machiavelli knew that political power was not for the timid.  He advised a potential prince on how to retain power.  Probably without intending to do so, he also advised those who did not have political power but wanted it.Some of Machiavelli's suggestions include showing intense force while feigning mercy. Machiavelli argued that a prince should instill fear rather than love because love is more fleeting and temporary.  Machiavelli taught a potential prince that he should blame and severely punish advisors if these advisors followed the prince's orders.  In other words, Machiavelli advised princes that if a policy went awry or cause resentment, a prince should scapegoat his subordinates with punishment rather than admitting blame or admitting error.Some have argued that Machiavelli's THE PRINCE was also a call for Italian unity or what was later known as Nationalism.  Machiavelli advised that military forces should be composed of native troops loyal to the ruler as opposed to mercenaries. Mercenaries were not to be trusted as they were loyal to paymasters rather than a prince of polity.Readers should note that Renaissance Italy was not united.  There were several political units such as principalities, city-states, Austrian-German controlled areas, the Papal States, etc.  Machiavelli knew that often these rulers called on "outsiders" to do their dirty work vs. their enemies.  Machiavelli was not the only Italian who realized that such outside "help" often made Italy a battleground for other Euroepean rulers to the detriment of the Italians.  This is why Machiavelli wanted a united Italy.Naive readers and dull pundits have associated Machiavelli with evil political disigns.  This is not true.  Machiavelli found the situation in Italy into which he was born.  The political divisions and intrigues were the facts of political life, and Machiavelli made a reasoned response to it.Machiavelli's THE PRINCE is also important because of the warning he gave to readers.  Whether he intended to or not, Machiavelli alerted readers how political power actually works as opposed to lofty speeches, constitutions, etc.  In other words, the alert reader should beware.  Another important lesson that Machiavelli teaches that political power is often composed of powerful groups whose survival and prosperity can last if there are compromises.  In other words, freedom is an important byproduct of these compromises.One may note that Machiavelli's THE PRINCE was written was written when crowned princes and rulers were trying to concentrate their power.  The old Medieval system of controls (checks and balances) were undermined.  There were fewer restrictions of parliaments, vassals, Cathlic Church controls, etc. to limit a monarch's power.  In other words, Renaissance rulers were able to use political and economic dislocations to rid themselves of prior controls.THE PRINCE is an invaluable guide to understanding actual political power.  Machiavelli was sure of himself because he was witness to rapid changes in political power, and he clearly understood the events that were unfolding even if others were not.  Those who assign evil intentions to Machiavelli betray their own naivete rather than any actual understanding  If readers have a difficult time with THE PRINCE, they owe it to themselves to give the book a more careful read
