I was originally drawn to this book because of the rather odd frog on the cover, which is good, because there are a lot of amphibious life forms within, hehe.  I was really not expecting the fast-paced, frantic, free-wheeling and fun read that this book turned out to be!  From the first page, to the last, you are never sure what is going to happen next, who is who for sure, or what the eventual outcome of all this madness is going to be.  It's an absolute joy.  I haven't been this entertained by a humourous science fiction or fantasy novel since the works of Douglas Adams, or the b-movie cycle by Craig Shaw Gardner.  Now I have to get the rest of Tom Holt's books
