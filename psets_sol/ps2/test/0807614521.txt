"The Three Perfections" is a thin little book and takes about an hour to read, but that's an hour very well-spent. Sullivan does a wonderful job of explaining to the western reader in an engagingly erudite manner why Chinese paintings, well, have writing on them. In the process he touches upon the history of this phenomenon and on the different types of inscriptions and their varying significance as well as describing the fully-developed Chinese art theories on the interdependence of painting, poetry, and calligraphy. All along he keeps the discussion concrete with multiple examples, usually with an accompanying illustration--and these alone are well worth the price of the book. By the end of it, someone who has loved East Asian art for a long time such as myself will still come away with a new appreciation of the subject, but Sullivan's friendly, unpretentious, and lucidly clear delivery is ideal for the curious beginner as well. In short, this fine little volume is perfectly enjoyable, informative, and aesthetically pleasing
