As is the case with most great writers, Cormac McCarthy's genius is primarily found in the details (the best words in the best order). His craftsmanship is given voice in soaring, searingly brilliant language that draws on distinguished forebears (Melville and Faulkner) and is welded to a subtle, layered and keenly perceptive moral vision.  A writer to whom we can turn not just to escape, but to learn, McCarthy is a master artist whose novels are built to last.Throughout "No Country for Old Men" (2005), the author fashions a sparse, carefully weighted prose (simplified in comparison to his masterpiece, "Blood Meridian") to portray characters in the varying, mottled condition of their souls. Their very flaws are what distinguish them in their (fallen) humanity from a man thriving in the realm of darkness. Discrepancies in plot and action, carped at by some reviewers, are in truth reconciled when seen as illuminating the wavering tendencies of the human beings portrayed and their various apportioned destinies.The hunter Moss steals drug money he comes upon in the Texas desert, knowing full well the danger it brings, not just to himself, but to his wife and extended family. His precarious balance on the tightrope that runs between good and evil leads him down the path to ruin.In the hinterlands (so we may believe) beyond good and evil, a hitman named Chigurh views himself as a walking talisman- an instrument simply acting out his destructive part in the human drama with the confidence that the predestined cosmic die has been cast. Chigurh manifests a demented, legalistic scrupulosity and honor in upholding the cards that have been dealt by fate and his role as executioner of a grim, aleatory philosophy.The narrative thread by the ageing Sheriff Bell (woven from start to finish of novel)- both his pondering of the bloody events and ruminations on a lie under which he has lived his life- charts the "fencepost" position occupied by most human beings. Unlike the nihilistic neutrality of the Kid in "Blood Meridian" (choosing not to choose)- Bell makes choices, some good and some bad, but none in the sense offered by Chigurh's false game of chance or ("Blood Meridian" ) Judge Holden's diabolic will to power.Every book by Cormac McCarthy deserves respect- if "No Country For Old Men" doesn't rise to the heights exhibited in "Suttree" or "Blood Meridian", it still ventures forth into a territory of the soul that very few writers are bold or talented enough to tackle.
