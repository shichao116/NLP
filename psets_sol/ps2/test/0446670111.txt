This slim little volume of 30 interesting, well-crafted vignettes is something.  I'm just not sure what.It's not a novel.  There's no story arc, no developing characters, no progression through dramatic ideas to some enhanced understanding.  It's not a collection of short stories.  It is unvaried in tone and style, treading the same ground over and over in slightly different ways.  It's not a group of essays.  There's no actual science or philosophy elucidated, no attempts to explain anything at all.What is it is what it is:  the work of an imaginative physicist with a gift for language mulling what ordinary life would be like if time moved differently than in the linear fashion we typically envision for it.  If it went backwards, at erratic paces, stopped predictably, changed based on location, etc., etc.  Each 5-10 page vignette is a self-contained slice of life from early 20th century Vienna, loosely posited as a month's worth of dreams Einstein had just prior to publishing the special theory of relativity  (in Annalen der Physik, if I'm not mistaken).  And, as such, it is certainly a quick and engaging read.However, beyond that, there isn't much to sink your mental teeth into.  Time and again the book provokes a "Hmm... that's an interesting way to look at things" response, but there's little that stays with you, haunts your dreams, makes you want to change your life.  Does every book have to do that?  Of course not.  But the great ones do.I guess I'm just a little taken aback by the fervor devotees of this book seem to have.  Yeah, I liked it.  You're right--I never thought much about how life would be different if we forgot the previous day every morning.  But we don't-- and I fail to see how simply picturing otherwise constitutes enlightenment.  So, go ahead and read this book.  Enjoy it.  Recommend it and talk about it with your friends.  Then go do something else, for Pete's sake.  It's a book, not a religion.Einstein's Dreams is Jonathan Livingston Seagull with a degree in physics.  Liking it is fine.  Quoting it makes it seem like you seriously need a life.
