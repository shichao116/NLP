I admit to having been skeptical when I read accounts that this was one of the greatest novels of all time, but upon completing Les Miserables I'm inclined to believe that this sentiment does not go far enough.  There are many novels which are entertaining--few which make you want to be a better man.  Les Miserables is a beautiful story told in a manner that is both insightful and inspiring.  It is quite a bit longer than the average modern novel, but upon reaching the end you will find yourself wishing for more.
