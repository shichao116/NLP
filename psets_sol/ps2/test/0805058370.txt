Pynchon is perhaps the greatest living author in the English language and this work even surpasses Gravity's Rainbow in its depth and maturity. Although some first time readers find Pynchon impenetrable the book is well worth adjusting to the author's sometimes quirky style. The man who made paranoia a virtue, for those who have never read Pynchon before it is almost impossible to describe his writing style -surreal, pedantic, comic, absurd, deconstructionistic, poetic it is all of those things and yet those words fall far short. To read Pynchon is an experience. Despite its length readers should find Mason & Dixon enjoyable and will find themselves craving for more at the book's end.Both cosmic and comic the book makes use of historical reference many of which seem unbelievable but are true (such as the duck automaton which Pynchon turns into an avenging killer),as was done in Gravity's Rainbow, add to the slightly surreal quality of Pynchon's writing in his blurring the boundaries between historical fact and fiction.As Gravity's Rainbow was a modern day Iliad set in W.W.II, Mason & Dixon is set in the years of the formation of AmericaTaking on opposing ideologies which continue in America to this date (such as his tale of the  battles between Jesuits and martial arts masters) Pynchon's writing though comic is philosophical and social commentary.Highly recommended
