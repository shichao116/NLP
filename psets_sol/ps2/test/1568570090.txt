If this book doesn't make you angry at the state of our school system, and even our government as a whole, then you must be communist!!!  This book gives alot of insight into the evolution of our &quot;modern&quot; school  system... where it came from, to what it has become.  Its not just a book  about theories, or ideas, it offers proof of many of its allogations.  If  you were a public school system POW like me, then it especially hits home  to see what was done to us,  how we were ripped off, and how we continue to  be ripped off.  This book will make you seriously think about home  schooling your child.  A great book for parents thinking about home school,  or anyone interested in how the government is trying to control us
