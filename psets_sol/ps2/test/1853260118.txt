A wonderful edition which includes both Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn (very handy for the Twain lover).  It also has a red bookmark attached to the binding so you can easily find your place.  The book is small and light  so it is ideal for travelling and reading out of your home.  It also  includes a nice introduction and a comparative chronology of Twain's life.   For a Twain collector, this is a lovely, readable copy
