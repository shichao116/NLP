I just finished 1776 (another McCullough book) a few days ago, and I really, really liked it. I'm about a third way through his Panama Canal book, and so far like it as well. This one seemed to me the weakest of the three, though still quite a good book and quite an amazing story. And as in the case with all of his books that I've read, thoroughly researched and analyzed down to minute details.The story of the Johnstown flood was completely unknown to me, but based on the author I felt pretty confident the book would be worthwhile. It is the story, with the background, of the breaking of an earthen dam in 1889 high in the Pennsylvania mountains, and the havoc that was instantly wrought. The story of the flood itself, when McCullough allows it to unfold and doesn't branch down too many biographical tributaries (as he is wont to do), is the best part of the book by far, and he does a more than adequate job of chronicling the events, here over a hundred years later.As the dam was owned by no ordinary group of sportsman, but men of the like of Andrew Carnegie and owners of the Pennsylvania railroad, the story gives us insight into the exploding iron and steel age in the U.S. This is perhaps the part that seemed missing to me, for in spite of the importance of the railroad and the centrality of it to this catastrophe claiming over 2,000 lives, I was still left wondering exactly how it fit in. A minor complaint.Overall, the book is well written, is enjoyable to read, and informs and enlightens. Consider this 4.5 stars.
