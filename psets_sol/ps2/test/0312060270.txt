I wanted to find an biography on Lyndon Johnson because I was doing a reading of a script for a screenwriters class based on his life. I chose this book because I do not usually read such detailed historical books. This book was very easy for me to read and understand. I was pleased that the background about his childhood was included because I wanted that for my research. I also think it is very interesting to learn about what makes a leader great - how he was raised, etc... I think this is a good book for someone who wants to get a thorough understanding of the complete life of Lyndon Johnson
