I felt like I was reading "MY Last Best Shot" as I read through this book.  I have three sons, ages 10, 12, & 13, and this book was lent to me by my middle son's teacher.  I liked it so much I bought my own copy.  Every chapter opened my eyes to something else I didn't know about or have not been doing with my sons. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with children near or at the pre-teen age level, particularly parents who find most parenting books boring, patronizing or unrealistic
