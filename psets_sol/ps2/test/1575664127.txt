This book is an easy-to-read and easy-to-follow guide for healthy eating.  The many lists, boxes with pertinent facts, and personal anecdotes from the authors make it very interesting.  I like that the authors are both  credentialed nutrition professionals with many years of practice in the  field of nutrition.  This book is sound advice that can be practiced for a  lifetime - it is not a fad or something that you can do for just a few  weeks and then it will be impractical.  The plan described in this book is  based on scientific literature and is sensible.  If you are looking to make  a permanent change in your health and eating, this is the book for you
