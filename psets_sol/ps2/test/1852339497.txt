I decided to learn access a few months ago. I brought a few books on the subject and hit a brick wall. Nothing was making any sense. I just wanted to build a database from scratch. I came across this book and it saved me from despair. It was exactly what I wanted. The other books that I had brought started teaching you multi table database right from the start and that's where it got confusing. This book is divided into several sections. The first three sections of this book teach you how to build single table databases and it will have you up and building a simple database in no time. This approach made it all make sense. After reading about 100 pages I built my first phone book, easy!! Part iv introduces you to multi table databases. By the time I finished this book I made a multi table data base for our business which everyone is using and loves. Now people are asking me to build more things for them in access, their goes my weekends??? I can't rate this book high enough. The Author, Mark Whitehorn, has a great way of explaining complex concepts into simple concepts and he also has a sense of humour which most computer book writer's lack. If you no nothing about access and want to learn access then this book is perfect. If there were more Authors like Mark Whitehorn then the world would be a better place
