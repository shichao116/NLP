this story is very exciting.I'm glad that Crane disappeared at the end,whatever his destiny is.The Sleepy Hollow is so secluded and beautiful that we don't allow anyone to spoil the beauty there.I view Crane as an intruder of the Tarry town.People there take story-telling,especially the horrable storys, as a pastime.This brings then some excitment.I myself brought up in the rural area, I can understand this
