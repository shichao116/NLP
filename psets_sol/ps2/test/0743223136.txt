Simply outstanding.  McCullough brings history alive.  It's not "history," it's a real story.  It may not be perfect historically, but it's pretty darn good.  And there is no such thing as "perfect" anyway when it comes to history.  It is perfect, however, when it comes to conveying - it's vivid, it's fully understandable, it's exciting, and it's not hyped because history at that period of time and the life and role of Adams was so exciting.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it
