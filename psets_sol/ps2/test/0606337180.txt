Junie B. has a problem that she needs to deal with and quick, she is scared of Halloween.  Of course her fears are based in "fact" because she got her info from an 8th grader and as she states they are almost adults.  She works through her fears in a logic that, I think, very much paralles the thought processes of a first grader.  Barbara Parker makes this girl take life in a fantastically funny manner.  She makes Junie intelligent and witty, sometimes to witty for her own good.  This was my first encounter with Junie but I can assure you it will not be my last.  A must read for either caretakers of small children or Halloween lovers of any age.
