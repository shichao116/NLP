Woodson doesn't tell the reader how to survey, do his/her own drawings, tell how to design a curb and gutter system.  I didn't expect him to!  He does walk you through how to get started on the path to be a land developer, including who and/or where to go for the details you will need to get further information, as well as the long list of subjects and details the potential developer needs to consider and explore
