In _In Search of Wonder_ (1967), Damon Knight devotes a chapter to "amphibians"-- mainstream authors who write a science fiction novel and then go back to what they were doing before. Some examples of amphibious books are Aldous Huxley's _Brave New World_ (1932), Bernard Wolfe's _Limbo_ (1952), Gore Vidal's _Messiah_ (1954), Pat Frank's _Alas, Babylon_ (1959), Anthony Burgess's _A Clockwork Orange_ (1962), Pierre Boulle's _Planet of the Apes_ (1963), William Burroughs's _Nova Express_ (1964), John Barth's _Giles Goat-Boy_ (1966), and Marge Piercy's _Woman on the Edge of Time_ (1976). Many amphibious novels are in fact more literate and original than a lot of genre science fiction.Is _On the Beach_ (1957) an amphibious novel? Knight argues-- and I concur-- that it is not. There are a few superficial resemblances to science fiction; but unlike the novels listed above, it is not really steeped in science fiction traditions. It is closer to such books as William Golding's _Lord of the Flies_ (1954), B.F. Skinner's _Walden Two_ (1948), Mordecai Roshwald's _Level Seven_ (1959), or Eugene Budrick and Harvey Wheeler's _Fail Safe_ (1962)-- novels that are eccentric but which were conceived and written as some kind of mainstream novel.Is it a good novel? You might think that a novel showing the world ending "not with a bang/ But with a whimper" is not a very promising proposition. But Shute is a writer who knows how things work. He knows how submarines and sailboats and Ferraris work. He knows what the best tires are for wagons and why cars are sometimes pulled with horses. He knows how to read a Geiger counter. He knows how Navy bureaucracy operates and what hard decisions politicians sometimes make. He knows the routine of running a farm or tending a garden. He knows why suddenly socks must be darned and shirts must be mended.  He knows what a postwar church service would be like. He knows what drinks not to mix together, and he knows the best wines to drink from the wine cellar. He knows how the trade winds circle, blowing radiation ever southward. He knows the symptoms of radiation sickness, measles, and cyanide poisoning.He does not know any more than his characters how World War III began, but he-- like the characters-- knows how it _might_ have begun. How there was a Russian plan for a Siberian- Shanghai railroad, and how this plan, incredibly, might have led to a war where split second decisions were made-- a war in which nobody could risk refraining from using kilotons of nuclear weapons. (Shute had been an areonautical engineer who knew a lot about weapons. This section, in spite of its speculative nature, rings very true.)He knows why people do certain things. He knows why some people try to escape into drink, others into the routine of work, and others into family affairs. He appreciates why some people do not want to watch movies except when they are drunk. He understands why some people still think of their dead family as alive, and why others might become morbidly obsessed with death.Shute draws you into the world of these people who desperately want to continue to live normal lives-- but who know that their hopes are futile. But... would things really wind down as quietly as we see it portrayed in _On the Beach_? No rioting in the streets? No breakdown of civil order? Just a few decent people accepting their lot with stiff upper lips? I don't know.  Shute writes so well that he makes you _believe_ that it could happen this way, but I Have My Doubts. In any event, _On the Beach_ is certainly a fine book that holds up very well, even after a period of almost 50 years.
