When I bought this book, I had rather meager expectations since I know well what happened before and after the telecom crash.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be a very informative book with some nice detail that I did not know about some of the crooks on Wall Street and CEOs of the companies that bilked billions from investors.By now, the book has become a bit of a history book.  Nonetheless, I recommend it as both an entertaining read and as a reminder that the same fraud is still going on.
