I read this book while in graduate school and found it among the more informative and fascinating books I read for the class to which it was assigned.  Genovese writes in an intelligent style that is fast paced.  This is not a typical dry history book.  Even though slavery in America is not one of my specialties, this book made me aware of things I never knew.Slavery is detestable to our modern society, but like it or not, it is part of our heritage.  The world the slaves made lives on with us today.  Genovese writes that white culture, particularly the culture of the poor whites, is very much in alignment with the world of the slaves.  This book traces religion, family, social structures, daily life, and the life as slaves that black Americans experienced.  Much of what is present (at least at the time this book was written and published) is clearly evident in the world the slaves made.  Let's face it, life as a slave is nothing anyone would want to recreate (no modern reality TV show would ever dare such a concept) but for those who had to endure it, they made the most of their lives and our nation has benefited from that experience.I recommend this book for American historians and social historians.  The casual reader may be intimidated by the length, but it is worth every minute spent on it
