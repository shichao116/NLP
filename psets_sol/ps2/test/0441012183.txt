I don't see anything exciting about this book. It was a lackluster shadow of LKH's vamp stories; sort of like Anita Blake on tranquilizers--ELEPHANT tranquilizers.The voice used for the story--Sookie Stackhouse--was too dry and uninteresting; and I'm not one of those who has a problem with first person narrative. Two of the best series around today, LKH's Anita Blake, and Diana Gabaldon's Outlander, use first person, and they are riveting.This is just too laid back for me--and I happen to like laid back, which is why Patricia Gaffney and Judith Ivory rate so high on my list of must-haves. But I practically snored through the sex scenes, and the rest of it was just too boring; I never got to like this girl with the should-have-been-funny-but-was-just-weird name.She thought of herself as the girl everyone else thinks is weird, and by the time I was about a third into the book, I thought she WAS weird. There was just this overall "I'm a dead-end (no pun intended) person, living a dead-end life" feel to the book that I couldn't get past. It was as if she were someone who had given up on life before she even tried it.I mean, she's a cocktail waitress with no future ambition to be anything else, who ends up taking money for doing something she should have done--Anita would have--for nothing. (And this book does beg for comparisons given its similarity to some aspects of LKH's work. Sadly, it suffers by those comparisons.)Won't put a spoiler here by saying what she should have done, but she just doesn't come across as someone who really cares for anyone else, or who anyone else really cares about either--not even her own brother. (You get the feeling he's only asking for money for her so he can borrow.)If nobody else cares about her, why should we?And if she were just a bit more sharp--why not have her ask for the money herself?--she would at least have had some edge to her. Instead, she's an ill-defined, amorphous blob, with no sharp edges, like a no-fat, no-salt diet of English 'cuisine'. Yuk.Sad to say, the author provides us with absolutely no reason to care about this character. Sookie is nothing special, in character, in intellect, in personality; she's just blah, a loser and too lazy even to care. Worse, she seems to think we won't notice, which indicates she thinks WE'RE losers too. I should like this person? No.The whole book is the forced interactions of a bunch of characters who seem disconnected from themselves and each other. The characters have no emotional investment in themselves, anyone else, or even much in what's going on; even when they 'rally for war', it's half-hearted and hard to believe (characters that have lived such long and dangerous lives don't have any better idea of how to go about taking out the enemy than what's shown here? Please.). It makes it impossible to invest anything in them yourself.Even the 'Bubba' thing, which should have and could have been an original and interesting touch, falters in the hands of this writer so that it seems--well, stupid.I'd had some high recommendations from a few people--should have remembered they also recommended K. MacGregor's Sword Of Darkness and Savannah Russe's Beyond The Pale--for this book. I suppose if your reading tastes aren't very broad or varied, it would seem like a decent read to you. But it never took off at all; despite dramatic situations and the introduction of what should have been but weren't interesting characters, this book was like reading an obituary--so I guess you could say it WAS aptly named. (Sure put me to sleep.*G*)I try to consider other reading levels when I give a review; there are those of us who have a wider reading experience, and there are those of us who are maybe still in junior high school or such, and just starting out. This is the only reason I give this book 3 and a half stars; I feel that for those whose reading level is junior high school or below, this book might seem pretty good.But for anyone out of jr. high, I really think this book is more a one to two star read; something you'd read if you had nothing else to read, or (as I did) simply because you told someone else you would; I wouldn't have finished it otherwise.I can forgive a lot in a writer if they can just give me characters I can care about, and plots or situations that are interesting; sadly, Ms. Harris fails to do either.I won't be reading any other of her books--unless I get roped into it again. :-
