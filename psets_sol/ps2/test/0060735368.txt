I love my mom, but sometimes is can be very trying to find out why we celebrate certain things.  Since her English is not as good has her Chinese and my Chinese is not as good as my English. SO I know there is something loss in translation.  If you are Cantonese especially of Toi San heritage, you will enjoy the book.  Many of the celebrations will be familiar to you.  My sister wanted me to by 4 more copies so she could give it away to people who keep asking her questions on New Years celebrations.  I ususally had to as our Mom now we just use the book.
