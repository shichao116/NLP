Everything about this book is huge- its length, its scope, its cast, and its research.  Mantel takes us to the razor's edge- showing how those brilliant men who engineered and orchestrated the French Revolution and its ideals lost control of their creation and became victims themselves of the Terror.  It is immensely readable, with engaging, complex characters.  Mantel does an excellent job of portraying Robespierre, Desmoulins and Danton in a way which leads readers to be sympathetic towards them while also being horrified of what they were party to.  An excellent read for anyone who finds the French Revolution fascinating, and a wonderful novel overall
