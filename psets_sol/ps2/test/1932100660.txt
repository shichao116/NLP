If you had asked me a month ago to pick my favorite book of the last decade, I would never have imagined picking a scientific book of nutrition studies.  But I would now.I am a serious skeptic of most food studies, supplements, fads, and the half-dozen or so nutrition books I've yawned my way through. What makes this so different is he produces such compelling data.  I love the way he provides references so I can chase down particularly astounding facts when my skeptical instincts kick in.Two things to know about this book:1.  It really isn't about the China Study, fascinating as that is.  Only one chapter is devoted to it.  The publisher chose the title and it is, unfortunately, misleading.2.  You ask yourself over and over while reading it, "Why haven't I heard about this before?"  It makes so much sense, Dr. Campbell is so widely published and respected, and the claims are so bold...  He dedicated section IV to this question. The answer is as compelling as the information he presents on the link between diet and the diseases we all fear.Now that the book is selling so well, my guess is beef, dairy, and drug interests are going to do anything in their power to cast doubt on it--and they have a lot of money. I think that debate will be very healthy, so to speak
