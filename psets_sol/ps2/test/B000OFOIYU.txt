I'm a fan of non-fiction, but not of military books in general. My brother "doesn't read books."

Even for me, there is a lot to hold my interest, and I am definitely not in the typical military history book group. The best part is that all the stories are really true, not just probably true, and the sources are in the back of the book so you can check it out
