As one who grew up listening to the music in the eighties, this book was the first in the series that I bought. The book itself contains not more than reproductions of weekly billboard HOT 100 charts from the first week of 1980 to the last of 1989. What makes the book interesting to me is that it brought back the good memories of the decade when I listened to practically each song ever made it to the chart, collected the records and stay tuned to the radio for weekly charts.This book is probably enjoyable only for those who went through the decade in music
