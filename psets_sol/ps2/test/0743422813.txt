Plain Truth tells the story of an Amish girl, Katie Fisher, charged with the murder of her infant child immediately after she gave birth to it out of wedlock. Ellie Hathaway, a hot-shot defense atorney gets suckered into taking the case though circumstance and extended family. Ellie herself has a biological clock like a timebomb about to explode and can't reconcile her feelings about having her own child with how Katie apparently killed her own child.This book really shines because of the inside view of Amish life it provides the reader. Even without the Amish thing the book is a good read though.One thing that I didn't like was that sometimes the author writes in a way that assumes the audience has given a good amount of thought to what it would be like to be pregnant and bear a child, and being male myself, these parts made me feel out of touch with the characters, especially Ellie, in the book. But the book is still very good to read, and I definetly recommend it
