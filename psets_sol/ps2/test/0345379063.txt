I bought this book based on the strength of other reviews on amazon.com and was not dissapointed.  Genuinely exciting, this is the type of book that you just can't put down, and when you do, you wish I could be reading it again.  Druss is larger than life and the obvious standout, but all of the characters are exceptionally well presented and you grow to care for them all.  I recommend this book to anyone seeking a great, exciting and very violent high fantasy war story
