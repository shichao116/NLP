It appears that there is consensus on this Amazon forum -- and in most other forums -- that TGPoT doesn't fall within the realm of PKD's greatest works.  But it's still a worthwhile read for the following reasons...1) PDK employs some tricks, that he's finely honed, to make the reader feel as disconnected from reality as the characters are.  He is so good at this that I actually felt off balance at times -- it's as if he were able to translate his mental illness, through the main character, right onto the pages of this book2) In addition to his mental illness, PKD also instills the book's protagonist, Pete Garden, with the other troubles from which PKD suffered: alcohol and drug dependency and a patheticaly poor ability to manage relationships.  I believe the very personal nature of PKD's experiences with the problems of the main character are what make the book so well paced and delivered3) More than any other Sci-Fi writer, PKD is willing to have his soul reflected onto every page he writes; and true to his nature, in TGPoT, PKD provides us with yet another window into his very distrubed and talented mind -- for me, this title slams home the fact that PKD is truly the Van Gogh of Sci-Fi4) In TGPoT, PKD empowers his characters with novel and unique precognitive and telekenetic powers that enables him drive the pace of the book.I took away 1 star because...1) True to the pulp nature of his writing style, you can literally  feel PKD furiously typing to get to the end of the book so that he can, in a mad rush, sprint to his publisher to, just under the wire, fling the manuscript onto his harried publishers desk, then with a quick but poorly executed pivot, tear away with his ridiculously small check, only to barely make the close of his bank in a hastening effort to convert it to cash, so that he can jump in his old peice of $%&^ car and speed to the nearest bar to plunge into a bottle of rot gut and eventually drink and whore away his money, so that he is forced to start the cycle all over again with his next flash of brilliance2) The game itself is probably the most uninspired concept I have seen PKD put to page.  He does though, use it as an effective tool for railing against capitalism (another common theme of PKD's works).Net/net: if you like sci-fi, read it
