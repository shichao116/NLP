I thought that this was a pretty good suspense story.  I was just sure that Claire's momma was the one that pulled the trigger and was surprised that Yasmine killed herself and not Allister or his family. So there, I surprised twice.  I figured midway through, that Jackson was Claire's daddy. I still thought that this was a very good story
