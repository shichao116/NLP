My sister and I each bought both of Georges' books.  They are both very informative.  We liked his easy going way of doing things.  His program is easy to follow and his recipes are also easy to make.  We have made several of them so far and all have been good.  Especially like his muffin recipes and the lasagna is very tasty, didn't even miss the noodles.  My sis really likes the baked zucchini fries
