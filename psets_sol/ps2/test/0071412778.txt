This book was great and very user friendly.  I knew it had everything (and more) that my text book had.  Regardless, I didn't even read the whole thing as I didn't have time too, but the "rapid review" was what I completly read.  However, I ended up with a 4 on the test.  To begin with it is an easy test, but imagine what you can do if you read the whole thing
