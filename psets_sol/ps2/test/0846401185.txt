When I read Oliver Twist, I literally could not put it down. I was getting in almost 90 pages per day!! It was so enticing, exciting, funny, suspensful, scary, whitty and downright fun. This is a testiment to Dickens' mastership, for it was his second book that he wrote. And personally, I think it is his best. Fagin, Oliver, Bill Sikes, The Artful Doger, Nancy, Mr. Bumble, Mr. Brownlow, Mrs. Maylie, all are wonderful characters that fit perfectly in this timeless masterpiece. Each of them have distinct personalities that are wonderful.However, I deeply implore yo to READ THE UNABRIDGED VERSION!!! You will not understand most of the plot unless you read an abridged version.Other than that, enjoy this wonderful masterpiece.Oh and, Bravo Mr. Dickens, Bravo!!
