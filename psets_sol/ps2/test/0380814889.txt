Like other reviewers, I found the ending rather awkward, however the majority of the book contains some of Mr. Silverberg's strongest writing in many years. The characters are varied and unique, and while many of them are duplicitious and scheming, they make for interesting plot twists. The story is well fleshed-out with eloquent descriptions that immersed me deeply in this alternate history.I must mention here in defense of the author, and reviewer complaints of stereotyping of Jews, that the author is himself Jewish. Events are told through the eyes of the characters, and most sophisticated readers will know better than to assume the opinions and perceptions of the characters represent objective "truths" in that fictional world or actual prejudices on the part of the author in our own. The real Roman empire was in fact beset with prejudices against various groups. Had anyone somehow missed all that, the ending should clear it up.Not Silverberg's best book, but relatively high on the list. The premise is ambitious, and he fulfills it well, with a humanism rare in alternate histories
