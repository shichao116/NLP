This book is the quintessential spy thriller.  The plot seems outlandish at first, two spies who hate each other teaming up to destroy an evil organization hell-bent on taking over the world.  Yet, Ludlum gives very reasonable explanations for every hole in the story.  For instance, the American spy Scofield and the Russian spy Talaniekov would kill one another at first sight.  However, Talaniekov receives word that he must find Scofield to take down this international organization of assassins.  He can't simply walk up to Scofield and explain the situation without being killed so he sets up a situation where Scofield's only move will be to realize that Talaniekov and he must talk to each other civilly.  The cat and mouse game that ensues between the two is, in my opinion, the best part of the book; each one trying to outmaneuver the other.  One other blunder that most authors make and that I expected Ludlum to make was in the development of the two spies' character.  Most authors will simply tell the reader that the character was "the most respected man in international espionage," the only evidence being that other spies will say that the person was the best.  Ludlum really proves to the reader why Scofield and Talaniekov are the best, not with overwhelming physical capabilities(which they both possess) but with superior intelligence.  The subtle moves they make that gives them an advantage over their enemies are very impressive.I especially enjoyed the relationship between the two once they've allied together.  It's not the amicable one that most authors would probably lean towards.  It's tentative, but professional and respectful at the same time.  We never see the two joking with one another.  The result of that is the ability to communicate large amounts of information to each other in very few words.  The addition of Antonia later on adds another dynamic to their relationship and raises the stakes of their mission.Also, a lot of reviewers have commented about the superiority of this book to The Bourne Identity and have questioned the reasons why it hasn't been made into a movie and The Bourne Identity has.  I think the reason is simply that this book wouldn't come off as well to a movie audience.  The details in The Matarese Circle(especially concerning the Matarese itself), which are often inconsequential in other books, are so important that it would take a 3+ hour movie to do justice to the book.  Even then, there would still be many scenes that would bore the movie audience.This book isn't filled with the "so-called" unexpected twists and turns that perforate the plots of most books.  It's just a solid novel saturated with colorful characters, interesting  relationships and an above average plot.  If you're looking for a thoughtful and engrossing page-turner, this one will not let you down
