I find it so sad that so few people have read or reviewed this masterpiece. I'm sorry to say it, but if it was on Christianity or the life of Christ the response would have been very different and this kind of  writing would have been equated with the likes of &quot;Paradise  Lost.&quot; I am not a Buddhist, but I was deeply moved by the power and  beauty of &quot;Light of Asia.&quot; It follows the life of the Buddha, who  was born in Dambadiva, India about 2500 years ago, to the royal family, but  left the comforts of his life and all worldly possessions to persue the  meaning of life; and gives us a vibrant picture of this great teacher and  his teachings, rendered in beautiful verse. An excellent way to find out  more about Buddhism
