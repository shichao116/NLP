I found this book to be quite informative about the unexpectedly interesting sport of professional bass angling.  The book is primarily about his journey from fun fisher to world champion professional angler.  As it turns out, this backstage tour of a sport takes you through a lot of hard times, uncertainty, emotions, personal growth, and (of course) gossip. That being said I don't really agree with other reviews that you will learn much about how to fish from this book; he does spend some time talking about specific techniques but usually it is something to do with his "stone jig" which he created and he gets 18 cents for each one you buy.I ended up with a largely sympathetic impression of Ike and his life journey thus far.  I would say that it is true that at times there is a certain bravado that feels more like a marketing ploy than a glimpse of his true personality.  But in the end, he is quite clear that he is interested in creating a brand of himself.  At times his discussion of any negative emotional episodes and his role in them did seem a bit juvenille. You know? (You'll get that joke when you read the book.)All in all, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it
