"Mal flicked his eyebrows at me once, his only admission to the acute self-consciousness we all feel, regardless of age or station in life, when anyone meets our parents."This is from Fenno, the narrator of the central, longest portion of Three Junes. It's false - such self-consciousness isn't something we all feel - and it's unworthy of someone who seems to be in his forties. I have no doubt that Julia Glass knows this; I think the passage is there to show us Fenno's solipsism. I spent most of the book annoyed at its main character. Fenno redeems himself in the third and final section, but that's fewer than 100 pages, of more than 350.It never occurred to me to stop reading, though; I barely thought to take a break. This immature, self-centered man compelled me onward. He isn't thoughtful enough to care about others on their terms, but I cared about him on his. This is a wonderful book
