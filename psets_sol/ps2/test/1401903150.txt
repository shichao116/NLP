Been a Wayne Dyer fan for some years so of course I would like his latest work. What has most impressed me about it is the impact it has had on my thrity two year old son. He recently went through a divorce and had been struggling with some other problems and some how this hit him dead center. He quit drinking, quit smoking and meditates as well as running again. The proof is in the results and I am impressed the impact it has had on him. I loved the book and feel like this one is a step up in a good way from his other work.
