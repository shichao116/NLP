Are you interested in wanting to understand and implement the IPv6 protocol! If you are, then this book is for you. Author Silvia Hagen, has done an outstanding job of writing a book that covers IPv6 in detail and explains all of the new features and functions.Hagen, begins by briefly explaining the history of IPv6 and gives you an overview of the new functionality. Then, the author describes the new IPv6 header format with a discussion of each field and trace file examples. Then, the author explains everything you need to know about the new address format, address notation, address types, international registry services, and prefix allocation. Next, she describes the new ICMPv6 message format, the ICMPv6 Error messages and informational messages, and the ICMPv6 header in the trace file. The author continues by discussing the basic security concepts and requirements. Then, the author discusses the basic requirements and types of QoS. Next, she discusses Layer 2 support for IPv6, the mapping of multicast addresses to Layer 2 addresses, and the Detecting Network Attachment working group. The author then discusses the advanced routing features of IPv6 and covers the available routing protocols such as RIPng, OSPFv3 for IPv6, and BGP extensions for IPv6, IS-IS, and EIGRPv6. Then, she discusses what is going on above the IPv6 layer, starting with changes for TCP and UDP, continuing with a detailed discussion of the DHCPv6 specification, DNS extensions for IPv6, SLPv2 in IPv6 networks, FTP, Telnet, and web servers. The author continues by discussing the different transition mechanisms that have been defined, such as dual-stack operation, tunneling, and translation techniques. Then, she explains why the Mobile IPv6 technology will become the foundation for a new generation of mobile services. Finally, she explains how to get started with IPv6 on different operating systems, such as Sun Solaris, Linux, BSD, Windows 2003, Windows XP, Mac OS, and a Cisco router.This most excellent book will show you how to plan for, design, and integrate IPv6 in your current IPv4 infrastructure. More importantly, it teaches you what you need to know to get started, to configure IPv6 on your hosts and routers, and to find the right applications that support IPv6
