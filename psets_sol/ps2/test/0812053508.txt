I bought this books soon after it came out as I lived in the city the author had his coffee shop in.  As his shop was a destination, just for the cheesecake, it was a no brainer to buy the book.  I spent several months working my way through all the baked and baked-flavored cheesecakes and can attest to the quality of all the recipes.  My favorite recipe is 'The Heavy One' followed by the pumpkin cheesecake.I highly recommend this book, especially if you have something like a Kitchen-Aid stand mixer to beat the cream cheese with.  Buy it, you won't be sorry
