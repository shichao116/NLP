Leadbetter's style in this book emphasizes a simplistic breakdown of the golf swing coupled with "how it should feel" descriptions which are easily understood and remembered and thus readily transportable to the range/golf course.  In other words, he does not fill your head with lots of stuff to think about while you're at the range/course.  Instead he provides one or two key thoughts or images which are useful to bear in mind while swinging at the range/course.More importantly, his drills which accompany the instructional breakdown, enable the reader to actually feel what one should feel during the swing.For example, feeling tension on the inside (the arch) of the back foot, at the height of the backswing, is now something that I pay attention to each time I swing and that has enabled me to add 10-20 yards to my drives.  After some practice, these "feelings" become automatic and do not have to be thought about during your swing.My chief criticism is that there are too few pictures and/or diagrams to help illustrate the instructions.  It is often helpful to see the same shot from many different angles.  Given the lack of visuals, it is important to study the text carefully.Other than that, this a very useful golf-swing-instructional book that unlike prior Leadbetter instructional books, dispenses with the technical discourses and boils the whole thing down to a few simple, useful thoughts and "feelings".
