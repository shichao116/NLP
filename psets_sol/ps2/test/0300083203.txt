...the first half of the book can be summarized as an argument that thinking about what you read will help you understand it better and thinking before you write will help you write better...I doubt anyone would argue with that...in the process they attempt to introduce various aspects of thinking that may help...most of the concepts, however, probably are ones with which you're already familiar...not surprisingly they manage to plug their other books, their website and their training seminars every few pages or so...and like many similar "pop" psychology type books there are many "anecdotes" of various indivdual successes they've had...the last half of the book is devoted to various "verbal intelligence activities"...unfortunately the activities are presented only in the most general fashion...for example, "Guess What" is nothing more than a guessing game where the teacher is supposed to provide clues to the pupil as to an object the teacher has in mind...no specifics as to what sorts of items and what sorts of clues would be best or most interesting -- it's up to the teacher to figure out should be chosen and how the clues should be presented...and this is the case in every activity...I don't know but if the teacher happens to be your average parent I seriously doubt they will possess either the time, energy or initiative necessary to come up with all the ideas required for the activities...moreover, I doubt that many would have sufficient training to know what ideas would be appropriate for a given age group, what ideas would be most interesting to a given age age group, etc...also, frankly, most of the activities presented seem quite boring...for example, one activity involves the teacher providing two words (e.g. cramp, lagoon) which the pupil is to use in a sentence...I just don't believe many kids would rise to the occasion for that sort of challenge...in summary, I seriously doubt anyone will find this book to be very useful -- either theoretically or practically
