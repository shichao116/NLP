I have read many books about Jesus in the past few months, all of them trying to get a scholarly handle on the "historical" Jesus.  Two things stand out about this one.  First of all, it is written by an accomplished novelist and biographer.  Secondly, although his investigations into critical textual scholarship cost him his faith, he is more of an apologist for the spirit of religion than the others - even though he doesn't buy into the theology.Wilson describes an uncomfortable alliance between the ultra-orthodox and the religious modernist.   The former is so afraid of Biblical textual criticism that he tends toward censorship of the subject.  The latter fully buys into the mythological origins of the whole Bible, taking virtually none of it literally, but maintains that religion matters more and at a deeper level than academic speculations.I'm not quite sure where Wilson fits into this scenario, because he meanders back and forth.  Over and over, he demonstrates why the irreconcilable contradictions of the New Testament render the whole thing unreliable.  Then he reverses himself:  "Yet, almost in spite of the Christ of the theologians, Jesus has survived:  a man doodling in the dust with his finger, while all around him, self-righteous men are shouting for the death of a sinner..."What results is a devastating critique of the New Testament as real history, mixed with a touching appreciation of the man Wilson found behind the myth.   No wonder this was a best seller.
