This book is unlike any other I've ever read before. Despite some editing issues, sometimes veering off into almost silly drama and obvious commentary, this is easily the most moving writen work ever for me.Kola Boof strings together words and phases and sentences to describe not just love, but the deepest pains of betrayal and loss so lyrically and poetically that it ignites brimstone within ones soul.The commentary, while admittedly "preachy", is so rawly truth-filled that to dismiss it, is to definitively choose blindness over sight.I dare you to be Black, especially a woman, read this book and not be changed. I dare you
