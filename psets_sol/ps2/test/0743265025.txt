As a 20-something, native Angeleno living elsewhere, I absolutely loved curling up with this book - everything typically LA/Hollywood is in here - it was like I was back on La Cienega, stuck in traffic, and people watching from the haven of my Jetta. The truths in here are undeniable - messy relationships publicized on the covers of tabloids, young children blindsided by the confusion of divorce, and at-all-costs publicity stunts. Readers looking for a good vacation book and who are familiar with the LA celebrity scene should be very happy with "The Starter Wife." It's the closest I could get to buying a plane ticket to LAX and walking around Malibu in Uggs.
