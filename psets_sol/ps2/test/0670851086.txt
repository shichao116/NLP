Ten O'Clock People, Rainy Season, Crouch End and Suffer the Children, this collection deserves a very solid 4 stars. These are solid and pure horror stories which are evidences that no one writes horror that good when King decides to write it the way he used to write when he started his career and these four stories (the first one almost a novella)are a showcase of everything that King makes good for a superp (horror) story: Spooky themes, well rounded characters even in one or two brushes of sentences, absurdly funny but to-the-point similes (very unlike that syrupy Koontz) King is a master of and a bizarre way of storytelling strangely addictive which I have yet to find in any author around the globe. While three of the stories may be tributes to other masters, Ten O Clock People is unashamedly King with over-the-top situations and with an unusual bubble of laughter when you are sweating through a chill-land waiting for the demons to rise and attack.Among other stories of course there are some clunkers but who has not? Even Poe had some clunkers but in time they are filtered through the history so King deserves its clunkers. But do not worry this collection embraces so many that apart from those four "five star" ones, everyone will find something, mostly in Dolan's Cadillac and the Moving Finger. There is a story dealing with how the world comes to an end (I cannot remember its long name)it is highly spooky and another proof that King is not a good storyteller but a very INTELLIGENT one also.This third collection convinces me once more that King is a very skilled author and it actually requires to have some literary taste and intelligence to grasp his essentials. Kudos from a four-year fan who used to think King was a mere schlock- meister
