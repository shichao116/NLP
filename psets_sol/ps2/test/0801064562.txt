In &quot;Just Think -- Nourish Your Mind To Feed Your Soul&quot;, I appreciate getting permission from the author to think, dream, investigate, imagine, and ponder.  Daily life may dictate an obligation to be relentlessly busy, but Ms Nordenson catches my attention and I can stop for a minute to think.  She lets me breathe.  She kindly hands me free admission into the life of the mind, encourages me to explore, and gives me some directional pointers along the way.  Since this is a book that I can pick up for short sections and easily-scanned quotes, I feel invited to come back whenever I want.  Highly readable and personally encouraging
