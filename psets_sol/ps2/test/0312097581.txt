Yes, this book comes with a set of runes.  That's the upside.  The reason this book causes so much controversy is that some of us are Asatru, we actually believe in the Traditional Northern European religion.  To us, the story of Odin hanging from the world tree to uncover the runes is like Jesus walking on water to Christians.  So when man from some other faith comes along, takes our ethnic divination system, changes the esoterically significant order, fumbles the divine meanings, and creates new parts (e.g. the blank rune), well you can see why some of us would be a little put off by this.  If you are a student of Norse culture, an Asatruar, or looking for a spiritual tool that resonates with the Ancient Tuetonic soul then I would suggest ignoring this book.  Try Edred Thorsson instead
