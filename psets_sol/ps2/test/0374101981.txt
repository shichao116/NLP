Approach this title with a nuanced eye. A national culture that has bequeathed to the world Shakespeare, Churchill, and the Beatles, not to mention Chaucer, the Magna Charta, and Princess Diana is not dissolving anytime fast. It is even questionable to propose that the England of 2006 is no longer a world power. What it is not, however, is the seat of a world empire, which seems to be the lament of author A.N. Wilson and the inspiration for this historical essay.This is an excellently researched and documented work that appeals to both sides of the brain, a compelling read with a clean chronological line and an interdisciplinary look at English social and political life. From Laurel and Hardy to the discovery of DNA, Wilson chronicles change on the island itself and in the nation's place on the world stage. Some of this decline, as Wilson interprets it, is discretely laid at the feet of the United States, which in the context of twentieth century world events seemed somewhat odd to me.The author begins his critique with the death of Queen Victoria, appropriately enough, in 1901 and the accession of her son, Bertie, as he was known, to the throne as Edward VII.  [John Adams giving way to George Hamilton, so to speak.] Victoria and the obsequious Disraeli had cultivated a "cult of empire" during the last quarter century of her reign, a heightened popular sense of the old maxim of the sun never setting on the Union Jack. Wilson implies that such a strategy was too much too late. For all practical purposes, by 1901 Britain presided over a commonwealth of nations. The empire, by this time was basically India, and as England's need for India increased this subcontinent was becoming harder and harder to manage.Later in the work Wilson will debate at some lengths the diplomatic and military options open to England in the Munich era and afterwards. In retrospect, though, the critical decisions about England's future were made in the 1901-1914 time frame. While Theodore Roosevelt in the US and young Winston Churchill in the Admiralty fretted about a global naval arms race, British royalty and high society danced through the last idyllic years prior to the world wars, comforted with the news from the Indian Viceroy Lord Curzon that India was secure along her northern borders and that the British overlords were much loved.Churchill, attuned to the naval state of affairs, switched the British Navy to oil burning locomotion in 1913, and then discovered that oil from the Middle East was getting harder to come by. The problem was an increasing German presence in the East, perhaps most obvious in the construction of railroad lines and roadways from Berlin to Bagdad. [134 ff] Clearly, England would need its subject India as a counterweight to German expansion eastward. My school day history books never described World War I as a quest for oil, but Wilson provides a compelling argument to think so. With a different energy policy and a more clearheaded Indian policy, England would have had no compelling reason to enter the fray.The miserable experience of World War I began a tumble of dominoes through Versailles [which did not solve England's Middle East woes], depression, World War II, and the loss of India. Wilson chronicles the impact of each upon British society, including the development of "The Special Relationship" between his nation and the United States. Wilson chooses not Roosevelt and Churchill but Laurel and Hardy as his metaphor [Stan Laurel having been born and educated in England before teaming with Georgia's Oliver Hardy] in a rather touching essay. One reads here the author's suppressed but real emotions about the American displacement from the Empire.This American motif appears time and time again. Wilson believes that England survived the Great Depression in a more effective and humane fashion than did the United States. Later he trumpets the socialized health plan of the late 1940's as an act of beneficence beyond the capacities of the US political system, and he comes just short of alleging that the US took advantage of British nuclear research to develop atomic weapons. He concedes, however, that without US [and Russian?] military force life under Hitler would have been unbearable, consigning the American nation to a kind of necessary evil status.Wilson chastens his own country for its management of Indian affairs and the shameful denouement there after World War II. The appointment of Lord Mountbatten to India seems to him particularly despicable. But he notes that England did not have a monopoly on rogues, and he is not worshipful of Gandhi or enthralled by Nehru. He laments the great loss of life during the Indian realignment as a metaphor of just how far England and the rest of the civilized world had fallen in fifty years.In a sense the first and last chapters of this work convey a different mood than the rest of the work: the first featuring the clotheshorse Bertie and the last the young and charming Princess Elizabeth. That royal succession could be celebrated uninterrupted so soon and so enthusiastically in 1952 after two generations of war and its attendant dictatorial demands upon the citizenry is a strong indication that the mystique and identity of England is not gone. The author knows this, but he mourns the loss of place enjoyed by his country in the 1800's and he is cautious about the future. In the final analysis, like a true Victorian he carries a thinly veiled disgust with the decline of civilization itself, with perhaps the unexpressed regret that much of the desecration was self-inflicted.
