Before he became a curmudgeonly hermit on the level of a B. Traven or a Thomas Pynchon, Salinger was a close and sympathetic observer of youth and life amongst the New York upper-middle classes.  The short stories he wrote from the early 40s through the late 50s placed him among the ranks of the best practitioners of the art.  In all, Salinger wrote approximately two dozen short stories, most of which appeared within the pages of "The NewYorker," along with those of his contemporary John Cheever, who was exploring the same territory but with a different emphasis.  Salinger specialized in quirky, high-quality tales spiced with equal amounts humor, philosophy, yearning, and sadness, and the far-too-few stories in this volume are a good representative of his work.  The emotional trauma of WWII - something which affected him personally and perhaps contributed to the man he is now - is depicted in differing ways in such stories as "Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut", "For Esme - With Love and Squalor," and "A Perfect Day for Bananafish."  "Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes" is written almost entirely as dialogue, "The Laughing Man" takes as its theme the magic of story-telling, while "Down at the Dinghy" and "Teddy" illustrate Salinger's famous empathy with children.  It's a pity and a mystery that Salinger only included nine of his many wonderful stories in this volume.  Apparently, to this day he refuses to allow any of his stories to be reprinted in anthologies, and has withdrawn permission to keep his stories in new editions of such older anthologies as "Short Story Masterpieces" or "Fifty Great Short Stories."  It's as if Salinger the artist for the last forty years has practiced a type of Zen self-abnegation, erasing not just his present but his past.  Why write if you don't want to be read?  What purpose, other than self-therapy, does art serve without an audience?  (But don't despair.  If you surf the samizdat of the net carefully, you'll find other stories by Salinger.)
