I have read &quot;Chocolate War&quot; and &quot;Beyond Chocolate War&quot; along with another book &quot;Hold on to Your Kids: Why Parents Matter&quot; by Gordon Neufeld, Ph.D. and Gabor Mate, M.D.and I found those books complementing one another brilliantly. While &quot;Hold on to Your Kids&quot; presents a theory of peer orientation (looking for direction to peers) and why it is destructive to immature, young individuals, &quot;Chocolate War&quot; and &quot;Beyond Chocolate War&quot; demonstrates this theory in action.Teens who have not yet achieved psychological maturity (defined roughly as being comfortable with oneself, knowing who you are and being able to hold on to your values and principles without letting another control you and make you compromise them)and who do not have developed close and meaningful relationships with their parents or caring adults, stand no chance to achieve maturity and the sense of oneself when throw into a community full of the same immature young adults i.e. school.Both &quot;Chocolate War&quot; and &quot;Beyond Chocolate War&quot; demonstrates intimidation and manipulation applied to young people who are unable to withstand it, because they are simply not equipped psychologically to handle it and who are also left &quot;to fend for themselves&quot; with no meaningful support of adults that surround them. Very sobering reading. Recommended to teens and especially to adults
