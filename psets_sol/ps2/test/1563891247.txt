This is a collection of The Batman Adventures issues 7-12 and is very cool. The art is somewhat different from the show, as it is more cartoony and over-the-top.

There  are some nice insights into the backgrounds of several of the Rogues  Gallery's members that fans will find very interesting, especially on  Killer Croc. This is a very good compilation that leaves me wanting more.  And so will you
