In reviewing what others have written about "Midnight Angel," I will not recount the plot, but I will add that I think the reviewer who gave it a poor review because of its format (e-book) in hope that it will be in book format is not a fair review.  I personally, after rereading this book about six times, am looking forward to it being published in book form.If you like "Beauty and the Beast " books, this is one of the best!  Douglas is a rough SEAL, used to women refusing even to look at him with his scarred face and broken nose.  Loving opera, as well as all kinds of music, he is beyond considerate and respectful toward Allegra, a blind singer and harpist.  He has the vocabulary to think about sex; however, he is bewildered and disbelieving about the intensity of his love for Allegra.  Most of this book is told from his viewpoint, and because he is just about perfect, it is a pleasure to read.  I can't imagine any woman not loving Douglas and this book, unless she objects to erotic novels.  If you love a protective, respectful Alpha hero and a lovable heroine, you'll adore this book
