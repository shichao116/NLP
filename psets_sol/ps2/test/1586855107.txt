Patricia Gebhard has done a superb job in carrying on the tradition of David Gebhard, her deceased husband, who was masterful at the collection of information on architecture and able to portray it to the reader in a very logical way.  It is the most completely detailed book written yet on George Washington Smith, one of the most forward and original developers of the the Spanish Revival style that swept America in the 1920's and has enjoyed a rebirth in recent years. The illustrations are excellent throughout the book, both old and new ones.  Anyone interested in this style of architecture, whether an architect, designer or any person interested in this style that has left such an important mark in American architecture, should buy and enjoy this book
