I loved the "Fall of Rome" and I was thrilled to find this book completely unexpectedly on my library shelf.  WHAT A BOOK! It grabbed me from the first page until the very last word.  I couldn't wait to turn the page to see how Ms. Southgate would turn her next phrase.  The 3 women are fascinating and multi-dimensional, the men in their life, interesting in their own right and not subjugated to staying in the shadow of these powerful and beautiful women.I can't even write much more than this.  I cannot intellectualize the feelings this book brought up in me.  I can only say, I LOVED IT...
