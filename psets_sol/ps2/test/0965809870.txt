This book is a quick read, and very informative as an introduction.  The layout and progression of topics make it very easy to follow, and there is plenty of good, current information on how to get started on moving to solar power.  Consultations with a couple of solar installers confirmed much of what I learned from this book to be true.  The appendix and references are worth a lot on their own.  Of course, you CAN find all this info on the web, but having it in one book to start out with is very handy.Just keep in mind this is NOT a how-to.  The author's purpose is to make you aware of what you need to know before you call an installer, not to tell you how to do it yourself, which he discourages for several reasons which he lists.  But he does show you how to size a system and give you a fairly comprehensive look at the different options and configurations that are available.Nice Job
