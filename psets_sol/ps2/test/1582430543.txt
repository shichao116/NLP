Where is my elephant  gun? Pay absolutely no attention to anyone who claims this isn't up to Lamott par.  All New People is not just a brilliant read, it is a superlative re-read.  I am so relieved I can now lend out my  dog-eared second-hand copy and purchase a new one for my shelves.  Fans of  Lamott rejoice...now all we need is a re-release of Joe Jones..
