So he's back in office for four more years and determined to do even more damage.  But there is hope.  The book has several lists in varying categories.  There are progressive groups you can join.  There are leaders, past and present, who are scarier than George W. Bush (one of whom is Tom DeLay).  There are rising stars, including Rep. Stephanie Herseth of South Dakota and Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois.  There are various chapters of simple therapies, including pet therapies (i.e. adopting a furry critter).  There are Bush jokes in between the subjects, six reasons to love global warming, seven anti-Bush movies, and the one way to tell if Bush is lying (and no, it's not "his lips are moving").If you feel despair or rage over what happened in 2004, you will find tips to put everything in perspective and help you survive the next four years.  If you are looking for something to show what went wrong and the possible chicanery in Ohio, look elsewhere
