More startling than the Golden Bough!  More conjectural than Manly Hall!  Who cares if the facts are correct?  This book is amazing, and enough of it matches up with familiar mytho-historical fragments to keep you going along, nodding your head and saying "yeah, I'm with you."  Graves admits quite clearly that much of his conclusions are pure conjecture.  This book isn't about history, it's about poetry and mysticism - if you're moaning about the disservice done to Celtic scholarship, then perhaps you've missed the point.  He was guessing.  He was making stuff up.  He was following his intuition, as long as it made some kind of sense.  And it does...Chapter 19 "The Number of the Beast" is a side-step completely out of the thread of the rest of the book.  He devotes the entire chapter to document, step by step, his train of though as he winds his way backwards, forwards, and completely sideways to arrive at a FRIGHTENINGLY plausible solution for the famous "666" cryptogram from the Revelation of St. John.  In fact, he arrives at the same traditional solution that theologians have known for centuries, but he arrives there by a completely different route.  This book is a supreme example of what management-seminar speakers call "thinking outside of the box."  Graves has gotten so far outside the box that he seems to have forgotten that there even WAS a box.  The incredible thing is, that there's a lot of truly amazing stuff out there and a lot of it sounds completely plausible after you've followed the circuitous chain of mental connections that got you there..Though I've read the Mabinogion, Chretiene de Troyes' Arthurian romances, and lots of Norse / Icelandic lore, I'll admit there was quite a bit here that went over my head, some material I was unfamiliar with.  But just when I thought Graves had vanished over the hills and left me behind, he'd come back with something familiar and I'd go "oh, right ... so that's where this was headed.  By all means, continue..."Reading this book is worthwhile just for the delightful experience of being on the edge of your seat as some smooth-talking showman (possibly a charlatan, but who cares?) slowly draws back the veil .. you feel at each moment that a profound secret is about to be revealed, maybe on the next page, or the next one...  It's been a long time since I read anything that THRILLED me like this book did.Some other reviewers seem to have missed the distinction between mere fact and TRUTH.  Graves' facts may be incorrect; you can pick at them and prove them wrong (can you? really?  personally, I wanted to believe every word), but the White Goddess is not diminished by scholarly dissections.  What Graves is talking about here is the profound, amazing, overwhelming, dark, unsettling, everlasting TRUTH.  And if you care at all about that, this is a book you really should read
