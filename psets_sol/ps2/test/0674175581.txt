This book is an excellent source for practising public managers and academics and students who interest in public administration. As time passed, people, their representatives and public managers change or need to  change their paradigms. Moore indicates the reason why public organizations  must change. Organizational posture and position always must be in  accordance with external environment.  From the perspective of Moore,  public managers  must move away from the technicians that work to  realize  the goals imposed by elected officials with the maximum efficiency to the  strategists that analyze the environment and find new ways for creating  more value for people. This does not mean bureaucrats  are completely free  and can think and do whatever they desire. We know this situation points to  the demolishing of the democracy. But Moore stresses that public officials  must be made accountable for the results and all the time they must be  oversighted by citizens, representatives, press, interest groups and public  at large.  This book is not a How-to-do guide. But we can adapt the  principles proposed to the unique circumstances of our organizations
