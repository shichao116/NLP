This book can be used as a guide (read it cover to cover) or a reference (just jump in and read specific parts).The author lives up to his promise in that he distills information from nine seperate books down to just one.  He does this by providing just the main information you need to get your network up and running.  It is very practical information.  While he doesn't dwell on theory, he does cover concepts so you don't just try to memorize steps but rather you understand the why with the how.Overall, it is an excellent source for beginners and intermediate network administrators.It was so well written even the humor was tolerable.
