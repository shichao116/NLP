Another great book, which comes as no surprise. The first book ends with him being removed from his home, permanently, due to his mother's abuses. This book gives us an insider's look at the foster home system, flaws and all, which rings quite true. I spent a week there myself, and have some delinquent cousins with a bit more experience. I suppose it'd shock a lot of readers, however. Meanwhile, what shocked me was that his mother was still part of his life. Grr! Great book. It's brilliant as well, and naturally I expect the same of the third part in this trilogy.
