This book was a gift from a friend whose judgment I respect. I tell myself that he must have recommended it because he only read Part 1. Indeed, this book's first 100 or so pages are terrific stuff, well written, descriptive, exciting, dramatic passages about caste hatred at the end of the 19th century in the south of India. I thought I had a great book on my hands: good characters, good descriptions, good action, and lots of interest. But then I went on to Part 2 and it's as if the world had spun around 180 degrees. The writing became turgid, dull, forced, absurd, uninteresting, and even pointless in many places. I ran out of energy to go on, but forced myself forward, hoping for the fireworks that started the whole thing off, only to be sorely disappointed. At Part 3, I admit I simply skimmed through to the end because I knew the author was taking the "plot" to the next generation of characters and, frankly, I didn't care much about the author's characterless, flat parodies of people anymore. I blame the publisher for not more firmly editing the material and for not giving the author constructive criticism and firm direction. But there are few good editors, just as there are precious few good writers out there. I think Davidar has a gift, but it needs direction. I hope he finds it.
