Ivan Turgenev was the first of the Russian writers of the XIX Century to make a name for himself outside his country. His novels influenced many of the great writers of the first half of the next century, such as Conrad, Virginia Wolf, Galsworthy and Henry James, who admired the Russian writer deeply.

"Fathers and Sons" focus on the conflict between younger member of Russian society that longed for reforms, and old intellectuals who were committed to political and aesthetical ideals of Western civilization.Turgenev is known as one of the most objective writers ever, and it is clear in this text.

As we all know, this change is called Revolution
