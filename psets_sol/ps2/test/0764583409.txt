This is an easy to use guide full of great information on Las Vegas.  It is the most complete and up to date guide available.  I checked all the new guides this year to see if any had the latest information on the new Hooters Hotel.  This was the only one that had the hotel listed under its new name and it also had all the new restaurants and other information.  Vegas grows and changes more rapidly than any other place on earth.  This guide does a great job of keeping up with the pace of change in Las Vegas.The only thing this guide is lacking is photos.  If you want pretty pictures I would recommend the Insight Guide.
