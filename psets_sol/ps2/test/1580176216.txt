I am so impressed with the patterns packed into this book, there is certainly something for everyone no matter what your taste in here.  You just have to see the "Maid Marian Cloak", and one of my favorites is the crocheted "Cinderella Cape".  I love the layout of the book, the schematics are very clear, and I myself really like the way the different sizes are presented....very easy to follow.As a bonus you do get a "leggings" and some "Gauntlets" in here that of course you can make probably to match just about any of the patterns
