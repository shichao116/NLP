This is truly an epic, an account of the struggle between the democracy of the United States and terrorism. After the initial, almost complete destruction of our government, we are left wondering how we will ever be able to put it back together again. At this point, the suspense is unbearable, and you must read on, you simply must. Of course, with the survival of the one person among hundreds of key politicians, who is the hero, Jack Ryan, we know that everything will be allright. But we don't know how, and we're anxious to find out. On the road to "happily ever after" we encounter one serious incident after another, any one of which could put us down for the count. Clancy weaves these plots with great precision, using the strokes of a master painter. Jack Ryan starts out slowly, cautiously, and seemingly unsure of himself, but builds confidence in himself to make the right decisions, and begins to issue his EXECUTIVE ORDERS to counterbalance and overcome the potential disasters facing him (and us).The sub-plots are intricately woven and very well connected, and in a book this long, many times the suspense is unbearable.Of course the good guys win, but this does not make the story trite, nor is this unusual in any way. It is the classic expression of the triumph of good over evil. And what's wrong with that ?My two favorite passages are Ryan's confrontation with the Prime Minister of India, a woman, when she orders the Indian Navy to interfere with the passage of the US Navy in the Indian Ocean as they are on their way to the Persian Gulf, and he (Ryan), in a telephone conversation with her, gets her to back down, after her initial coy belligerence; and Ryan's confrontation in the oval office with the one who betrayed him.The story is very long and sometimes tedious because of all the details, but overall it is terrific reading-one of the best books I've read in a long time. I always thought Ludlum's spy thrillers were good, but I think Clancy has pushed it up a notch to the next level
