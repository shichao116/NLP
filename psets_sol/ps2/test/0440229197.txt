in the beginning mr. chickke gives steven a quardrillion dollar bill. steven show's his parents and he and his dad go to the treasury department and meet agent fondoo. fondoo offers them a reward of two thousand dollars. fondoo then talks to his boss and is told to recover that government dollar. when steven, russel, and zoopy the giant dog start to go to the bank feds chase after him. They ride zoopy to get away from the feds. Will they make it?i think this is a really great book. I liked when they ride zoopy. It was funny and had action in some parts of it.  i reccommend this book to anyone with a good imagination. Also when Steven's old dictionary writes mean messages to him i laughed. I hope you will like it too.
