Stephen King steps off into the woods and gives us Trisha McFarland. She's out for a day of hiking with her mom and brother (who don't get along) when after a quick step off the trail, she becomes lost in the wilderness. This book does not have the same supernatural theme that King normally uses, but this story is uneasy nonetheless. Getting lost in the wilderness is much more real than vampires and werewolves, and King does an excellent job giving us real insight into Trisha's thoughts. This book is one of my favorite Stephen King books.
