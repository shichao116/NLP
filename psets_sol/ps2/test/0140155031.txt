"I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race."The whole book is filled with stuff like this: at first glance full of depth and meaning, and at closer look fancy jibberish.  Academia has praised this book for a number of reasons, most notably its innovative stream of conciousness style.  Critics and high school lit teachers alike seem to agree that James Joyce is pretty great, and this is one of his crowning achievements.  Honestly, I'm not sure I see it the same way.  The book doesn't exist on its own plane of unqualified excellence as I had been led to believe.  Many of the characters, although based on real life counterparts, lack depth and development.  A lot of this has to do with the entire book being presented from the main character's point of view, so we are not allowed to see any other perspectives of the events that unfold in the novel.  A lot of the action doesn't really seem to add to the overall story, either.  It does not appear that the main character grows from any of the situations or that they have much of an effect on later developments.Despite all of this, I still enjoyed the book, as should be evident by the 4 star rating above.  I liked the book because of the first point I made about specious depth in the writing.  The book is written in its own highly esoteric language that I really got a kick out of.  That line I quoted earlier may not really mean anything on its own, but it just sounds so damn pretty, how can I resist it?  This book is certainly not for everybody, and it takes soem getting used to for the first hundred pages or so.  But once you realize the plot doesn't matter a great deal, you can relax and be swept away by the language as only Joyce can command/subvert it
