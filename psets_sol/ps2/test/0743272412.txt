There are times when even the most sophisticated readers need a break and want to read what I call an &quot;airplane&quot; book--&quot;beach&quot; book would also be a good description--at the same time it's hard not to get annoyed with poor writing, unbelievable dialogue and dumb plots. If you've had this problem, try Pears' books.   This is the first of the series I've read, and found a good plot with an interesting smidgen of art history and modern Italian culture woven in. I had the added bonus of reading it during a flight home from a 2-1/2 week sojourn in Tuscany and Umbria! This book bears no resemblance to &quot;Instance of the Fingerpost,&quot; which was a serious literary work; this is for fun
