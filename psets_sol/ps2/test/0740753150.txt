at how Lynn Johnston keeps a fresh, new perspective in her comic strip. She's not a "funny" as her old comic strips used to be, but she always hits home, and always leads me to look forward to the following strip. This book is another wonderful collection, with insight, some good puns, and a couple of laugh-out-loud moments. But mostly, the ability to know your life is "normal!" Lynn Johnston identifies with us, and then draws it. Wonderful
