You know you're in good hands when you open this book.  But it takes more than just an incredible set of credentials (Bram Stoker Award, several novels and over 15 anthology appearances) to be an effective teacher.  It  takes a broad understanding of the writing craft and business, and an  organized approach--all of which Van Belkom has with this book.  It's a  fast (216 pages), informative primer for new horror writers, and perhaps a  nice refresher for the pros.  Covering all the topics a book like this  should, such as composition, marketing, and the current state of the genre,  Van Belkom is at his best when he dissects his own stories and experiences  for the reader's benefit; I'm just disappointed he didn't give us  more--more meat, as they say.  If you're still in the  I'm-embarrassed-I-love-horror stage, Writing Horror has a flexible, paper  cover that's perfect for folding over when you're on a crowded subway
