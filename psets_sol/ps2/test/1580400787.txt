This book doesn't have many recipes in it.  It has some.  Mostly it has suggestions such as for dinner you are to get a thin and crispy pizza from Pizza hut and have a salad with it.  Or for Breakfast 1 package of instant oatmeal, wheat germ, 1 mini pack of raisons, and 1 cut fat free milk.  For lunch one such suggestion is 1 Stouffer's lean cuisine cheese cannelloni 1/2 cup steamed broccoli, with margarine and 2 bread sticks and 2 cups mixed berries.  Those aren't recipes!!  The recipes are ok but because my husband is a picky eater we can only try about 5 of them.  There are only about 28 recipes included.  I'm not totally sorry I bought the book because my husband is newly diagnosed and it does have some good information in the book for newly diagnosed people.  I will NEVER buy any of the others
