This was a comprehensive guidebook that gave enough information on all subjects to get you where you were going, tell you how to do things, and alert you to diverse sites and events that were especially interesting.   Most important was its way of presenting enough historical, cultural, and  political information to make one aware and able to navigate Barcelona's  unique environment while at the same time exponentially increasing  curiousity.  We were working up until the time of our flight and skimmed  the book en route.  We had never been to Spain, didn't speak Spanish and  yet spent two weeks in Barcelona without any difficulties and used only  this book as our guide.  As a direct result of the ease of use and interest  the guide book piqued we bought and read many books on Catalonian history,  political history, social culture, Picasso, Gaudi, architecture, etc. while  we were exploring the city, making our two weeks of travel instead of a  tour of cities into one of the more in depth, interesting trips we've ever  taken.  In three months we've given a copy of the book to two other  families going to Barcelona, tracked down the other Insight Guides and  begun to plan next summer's trip around one of them
