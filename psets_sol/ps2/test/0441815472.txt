Robert Heinlein is my favorite author.  I may have read every science fiction story he had ever published. My computer is even named Mycroft (ref: Moon is a Harsh Mistress).So, it was no surprise that I really enjoyed this book.  On the other hand, I could see this book would be a strange read if you had not already read most or all of the other "Howard Families" related books.In this book, Maureen, the main character, is dictating her life's story while held captive under unusual circumstances.  There are many loops; personal, familial, historic, temporal and ironic, in her life that entertain, intrigue, and pique the imagination.  Almost all of the stories that make up her life are related to other SF works that RAH had published in the 40 years before this book was released, so I loved the way it reminded me of so many stories I had not thought about in years. You may have to re-read several other of RAH's works after this experience.Maureen is a precocious, lusty, passionate, and determined lady who's life covers the transistion from the horse and buggy era into the modern space age and beyond. She has solid values, but they are not often the sames ones that our society condone.There is not much of a specific story line in this book, so that may disappoint the SF fan who likes action leading to a goal or conclusion.  This book is not like 'Moon is a Harsh Mistress' or 'Starship Troopers'.This book has lots of sexual activity, sometimes occurring with various partners whom our society suggests are 'wrong'. This could be enough to prevent some folks who prefer conventional sexual mores from enjoying the story, or cause them to disapprove of, or dislike Maureen.I happen to like her, and would love her as a friend, or more, if she were a real person in my life.Heinlein's books often present social mores which differ from the Puritanical societal pressures so common in America.  He protrays themes of libertarian beliefs, including personal responsibility, parenting responsibility, discipline, freedom of choice, open sexuality, and suggests government systems should be trying to provide a safe environment for each of us to find our full potential. The government is not our parents and should NOT be telling us how to live our lives. Nor, are we entitled to the fruits of someone else's labor, simply because they have more than us, etc.  This is a far cry from what the United States has become in the past four decades.As a huge fan of RAH's work, I would recommend anyone read the other books in this series first to get the best out of this one.Methuselah's ChildrenTime Enough for LoveThe Number of the BeastThe Cat Who Walked Through Wallsand others.
