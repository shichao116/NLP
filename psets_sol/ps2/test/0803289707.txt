John Wayne is arguably the most important American film actor ever. His iconic status is rivaled only by Marilyn Monroe and Humphey Bogart. He was really three people, I think:1) Marion Morrison- Bright, well-meaning, troubled, unloved and unguided. A loser for a father and a harpy for a mother.  He overcompensated for his lack of parenting & lack of support by overachieving. Alas, nothing he did was good enough for his hateful mother.2) Duke- He, understandably, hated his girlish name.  He named himself after a dog who walked to school with him. Having a nickname which became, in effect, his second name enabled Marion to recreate himself in his own image.  Duke was cool.  Duke was a man's man.  Duke drank and told dirty jokes and yelled and raised hell.  Or at least he tried to. The macho posturing he admired so much in John Ford, Howard Hawks and other older father figures never quite fit the often shy, somewhat thoughtful, hesitant, book reading manchild who hated horses and physical labor and freely admitted women confused and scared him and could never handle his own finances.  Time after time, Duke invested poorly, trusted dishonest people or simply wasted gobs of money on expensive junk. He ducked WW2 and enthusiastically cheered the Vietnam War and The Alamo. Right sentiment, wrong wars. He had a bunch of kids who were only able to see him if they visited him on the sets on the dozens upon dozens of movies he made.  He liked making movies. They made him feel strong, important & needed. The movie sets also served as a convenient escape route away from his often unhappy wives and depressing feelings of failure as a husband and father.3) John Wayne- A name Duke neither picked nor particularly cared for. Off camera he was Duke.  Not Marion and not John. John Wayne was the consummate macho tough guy.  Tall in the saddle and serious of purpose.  A man's man who talks tough and gets the job done. He doesn't quit, shirk or shy away. A fascinating study of the values of middle America.  They shaped him in their image and, after many years, he became an ideal to strive after.  He was a cowboy or a military man in nearly all of his movies.  The embodiment of America's "can do" and "don't tread on me" values.  Often, he was a hardened loner, a flawed but inherently decent man, who did the tough dirty work so others could live easy.  He lived by a code of honor never written down but known by heart.  John Wayne was as American as baseball and apple pie.
