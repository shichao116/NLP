I'm not surprised - I knew Gowdy was an artist when I picked up her novel &quot;Falling Angels&quot; by accident.  This book of short stories is an incredible and dizzying fall into the world of the bizarre - where  everything that is off-the-wall, quirky, and unacceptable, becomes normal,  textured, and sprinkled with a bit of reality - though not to the point of  being ho-hum.  Oh, no! Barbara Gowdy will grab you by the neck and MAKE you  admit it's a beautiful world, filled with odd, gorgeous people.  I love  this author - she is the only writer I've ever known who revels and  celebrates the crazy shapes and colours of the human animal
