The protagonist is a wannabe sexual masochist (male), longing to be dominated by a beautiful cruel sex-goddess.  He meets his dream girl (Venus) who he slowly seduces into (reluctantly) satisfying his masochistic sexual desires.  Venus is hesitant at first, then really begins to enjoy the role of cruel dominatrix, to the point that she makes him her total slave.  Eventually her sadism far surpass his masochism, causing him to re-think his lust-affair with masochism. In the end he decides that maybe things would have worked out better if he had whipped her into submission, instead of the other way around.This book is not in any way spiritual, unless paganism is your religion
