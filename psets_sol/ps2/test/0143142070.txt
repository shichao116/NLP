When I bought David Lynch's audio book, I knew what I was buying - an audio book about why we should meditate and the benefits that Mr. Lynch has experienced from meditation.  I think many people expected him to offer more insite into who he is and I think he did this quite well.  It was refreshing to listen to Mr. Lynch read his book, in his own voice and with his own mannerisms.  I found it very interesting and informative and I highly recommend this book!  I wasn't a big David Lynch fan before but I am now
