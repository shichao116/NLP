Well if you want your mind expanded, then Dolores Cannon is the place to go. There's nothing else quite like her books. We all think there are no answers to this world, that either it's all meaningless or else we're unworthy to know the truth or we'll have to wait another 200 years for science to figure things out. Well that's just wrong. Answers DO exist... provided you're willing to have an open mind about their source. An awful lot of questions people have had for thousands of years about life, the universe, and everything are answered in this book along with the prior one (PT. 1). I don't expect the mainstream to catch on right away, but for those willing to go off the beaten path, literally everything you've ever wondered about in our world is dealt with in these books. Few volumes can change a person's life, but Dolores Cannon's do just that. I was excited to read in this one where she mentioned material she was saving for PT. 3, so the good news is we've got another one to look forward to. Trust me, you can't go wrong on this purchase
