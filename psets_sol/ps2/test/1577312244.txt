Heather Williams has written a book for the private person who wants to  increase self knowledge in the privacy of their own home, and at their own speed. The sequence of information allows for the reader to browse and do exercises as they are moved. It gives theory blended in with practical suggestions on how to do your own self discovery, one self determined picture at a time. She is sensitive, thorough in her explanations, and offers her own examples so that the reader is reassured that this is a book for everyone,rather than for acclaimed artists.  Ms. Williams stresses that everyone has artistic ability and she shows us inroads to discovery of our unique expression of the art within each of us. This book is more than a self-help manual-- it is a self discovery map for the seeker of self knowledge
