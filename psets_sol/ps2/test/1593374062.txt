I really enjoyed reading Cliff's book. In October of last year I attended an Ebay University course in which this author had been the presenter.  This is how I discovered the book. As a live presenter, Cliff was very humorous but concise about the fundamental aspects of running a business. His eloquent yet lighthearted insights into the trials, pitfalls, and realities related to successful business practices have been explained in this book. I recommend it very highly
