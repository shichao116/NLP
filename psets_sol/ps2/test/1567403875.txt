Let me start by saying this is my first Greg Iles book and I'll be back for more!Joe Hickey has pulled off five kidnappings for ransom, each a year apart.  Not only has he not been caught, but none of the parents of the victims ever reported the crime.Now it's kidnapping time again and Joe sets his sights on Abby Jennings, the five year old daughter of an anesthesiologist and his Junior League wife, who resents her husband's success and social status.Joe's retarded but lovable cousin, Huey, will take charge of Abby.  Joe's wife Cheryl (a former prostitute) will monitor Abby's dad Will and Hickey himself takes charge of mother Karen who turns out to be a lot tougher than he anticipated. The fact that Abby has juvenile diabetes increases the chance that Will and Karen will never get their daughter back alive.The action shifts between the Jennings' Mississippi estate where Hickey holds Karen prisoner, to a cabin in the woods where Huey hides Abby to a medical doctor's convention on the Gulf Shore, where Cheryl keeps Will from calling the FBI or police.As the Jennings parents engage in a battle of wits with Joe and Cheryl Hickey, Abby and the childlike Huey entertain themselves in their secret location.24 Hours has one of the cleverest criminals and best thought- out plots I've encountered and you really come to care about the Jennings family and their individual fates.  Strongly recommended for page turning reading!
