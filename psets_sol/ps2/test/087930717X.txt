I never go into a jazz store without the book or notes from the book in hand.  It has rarely steered me wrong in ten years of use. Don't believe me. Just look up an artist you have several selections by already and see how close their observations are to your own. The book is in plain english but with smart reviews that do not seem preachy yet make the point.  The whole AMG series is fine but the jazz one is great especially if you are building your tastes or collection
