I call this the "dust-bunny" series - third book after After Dark and After Glow - this paranormal romance features Elly St. Clair, former fiancé of Cooper Boone.  Elly and Cooper live in Harmony, a planet of colonized humans who have developed psi abilities.  Cooper is in charge of the guild of ghost hunters in Aurora Springs, and therefore suspect to many people, including Elly.  But Elly must swallow her pride and ask for Cooper's help in going into the catacombs to find her friend, a ruin rat.  Cooper just happens to be in town, unbeknownst to Elly, and their partnership begins to bring the romance back into their lives - along with murderers and smugglers.  The dust bunnies ARE the story, IMO.  Great stories, lots of humor, and a great read
