I don't read a lot of mysteries, so I'm hardly qualified to review one.  But reading this one helped me clarify what I want out of a mystery  novel.   I want all the necessary and relevant facts presented to me to solve the mystery, and I want the detective to be so brilliant that she  sees what I can't and solves the mystery in such a way that I go, "Of  course!  It was right in front of me all the time, I just couldn't see it!"  That's fun reading.Maybe that's rare, I don't really know.  This book doesn't have it.  When the mystery  is solved, the culprit turns out to be a minor character, and the conclusive bit of evidence was gathered by Wimsey outside of the story.  It's really  more police work than detective work, and it ultimately feels anticlimactic to me.What Sayers does do well is explore her protagonist's psyche and her complex relationship with Lord Peter.  Rarely have I read a better account of grown-ups trying to figure out a relationship; this is not flowers and romance love, but it is love, and I enjoyed the complexity, subtlety, and seriousness of it. In the end, Sayers (in this book, anyway) is really more like Jane Austen than  Agatha Christie, and I guess I just wish I'd known that going in.
