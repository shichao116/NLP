Fierce Invalids was the 5th Tom Robbins book I read, and my favorite since I was first introduced to his philosophy and writing in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.  Over time I had found Robins' mantras and prose to be somewhat repetetive and expected after reading too many of his novels.  However Fierce Invalids broke free from the ordinary mold while sticking to the Tom Robbins zaniness and intelligince.  The philosophy and humor were fresh with irresistable characters. Despite my love for Cowgirls, Fierce Invalids has quickly become my favorite Robbins novel.  I recomend this book to any and all Robbins fans
