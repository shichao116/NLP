I've been listening to these CD recordings for three weeks now, going over and over this magnificently empowering message from Abraham and delivered through Esther & Jerry Hicks. I was so impressed with their first book -Ask and It is Given- that I just had to listen/read this one as well. For me, I've found that the message is better felt and understood when it reaches inside through hearing and sight simultaneously, let's say in a sort of "stereo" kind of way, so I read the book and listen the CDs at the same time. For anyone who has been looking for a sensible, charismatic, loving and understanable perspective of self, purpose and access to Joy, try this (read, listen or both), there will be no regrets. My own ability to "listen" (as opposed to hear) is limited by -point of view-, that is, it's filtered through belief; only something more powerful than that belief can shake and crumble it allowing acceptance of another that will further growth, understanding and joy. That is the power of this book and that IS what I want and NOW and more than ever before BELIEVE I can have.
