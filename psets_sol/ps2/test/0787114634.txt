I really liked the book but it made me very curious about the author.  Does anyone know who the author is?  I am trying to track him down and not having much luck.  I am wondering about the screen plays he's written ... any made into movies?  What writing award did he win?  Are there other works of fiction available under another name?  I guess I am more curious about the author than anything else
