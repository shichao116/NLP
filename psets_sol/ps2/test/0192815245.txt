a delightfully horrific, gothic masterpiece for the twisted mind to enjoy. lewis wrote this in 2 weeks at 19 years of age (if i'm not mistaken) so i dont know what was happening in that man's brains during the writing of this ...thing. but what i do know is that it's an eternal reminder that good and evil are constantly swapping places. see for yourself
