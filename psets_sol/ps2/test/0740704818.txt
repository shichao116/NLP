You cannot get a better message and uplifting photos for $10.  It is such a bargin. Yes, I know the preview here at Amazon does not show you much, but this little book will inspire you, make you think about life, and is a wonderful little gift to a friend or loved one.  It is also fine for children.  I like "Tomorrow," "Blue Day" (perfect for friends feeling sad), and "Friends to the End." I love this author work and if he is reading this, thank you.
