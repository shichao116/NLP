I've been studying Tarot on and off for many years, and have a shelf full of Tarot books. This is probably my most frequently referenced book. She does a really great job of exploring the many possible meanings of the individual cards. I have only skimmed the parts on readings but there are some good insights there as well. I'm so glad they combined the two books into this one excellent resource
