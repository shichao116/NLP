They were giants. Franklin, Paine, Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson, Adams, and Monroe. Names synonymous with greatness. But if they were the rock stars of their time, George Washington was Elvis, Mick and the Beatles rolled into one. Standing six feet three inches, athletically built, well bred and handsome, he could have come direct from central casting. But, while he never lost site of the benefits of form, this was truly a man of action. When others fretted about French/Indian incursions in the Ohio territories, farmer Washington took up arms and became Colonel Washington, the citizen warrior. When the British moved to occupy Massachusetts, he again left his beloved Mt. Vernon to lead men into battle. Lead here is the operative word. Through the discerning eyes of Joseph Ellis, a historian who can also write, we glimpse the human inside the monument. A reluctant warrior, Washington is more wily Fabius than  bold Caesar, more Eisenhower strategist and less straight-ahead Patton. But, if Allied Commander Ike had his hands full with Patton, Monty and DeGaulle, imagine controlling uber-egos like Hamilton, Franklin, Adams, Jefferson and Madison. Even during their most virulent political battles, Jefferson, Adams and the rest knew His Excellency General Washington was the headman. Yet, the capstone of his greatness came not when the general ascended to His Excellency Emperor Washington but when he became simply Mr. President.
