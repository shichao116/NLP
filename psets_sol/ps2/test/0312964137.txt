The skeptic is typically one of the better Students in any of Davids classes!Psychic Warrior will not "make" you a psychic, nor will it instruct you on the specific protocals necessary to do a Remote Viewing session.  That is MUCH better served in a classroom setting with David and his Wife Patty, several committed Trainers and a Group of Interested and Excited Students.Psychic Warrior will not make you "psychically see." But this book will introduce you to David and his background, and allow you a peek into some of his past personal and professional dramas and experiences.  It will also entertain you and alert you to some of the "other stuff" that is usually well-veiled behind some stragically placed black curtains of Oz. It may even interest you enough to want to reach out to pull back that  veil!Just as there are many different paths to any truth, there are several different avenues through which one can learn Remote Viewing. David Morehous and Remote Viewing Technologies is IMHO the Best Platform from which to launch oneself into the Matrix of All Creation - the realm of the Collective Consciousness.Read the book and decide for yourself.  That you are here reading reviews says to me that you are interested enough to look.  Pull back that curtain with YOUR OWN HANDS, and see for yourself what so many others continually say is only an illusion.  It's only through YOUR OWN EYES that you can TRULY See.
