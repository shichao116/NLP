Medina takes you back to your childhood with his depiction of the life and times and dreams of Deshawn Days. This book take you right back to age ten and it'll resonate with you whether you live in the Projects or on Park Avenue. My Grandmother's Legs is one of my favorites because Medina's description of Deshawn's grandmother is practically identical to what my own would be. The death of his grandmother hits home with anyone who has ever lost a relative who was close to them. Only a true artist can capture that. Medina is superb!James Smith
