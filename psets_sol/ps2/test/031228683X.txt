This is one of the objective biographies about late Egyptian President and Arab leader Gamal Abdul-Nasser. Even though Said Aburish expresses his admiration of Nasser toward the beginning of the book, a statement which warns the reader of a biased account in favor of Nasser, the book eventually proves to be otherwise.According to Aburish, Nasser was a popular leader only and had no vision, platform or plan for the Arab world. Aburish correctly argues that Nasser had two positive sides only to his leadership: The first is that Nasser was never corrupt and the second is that his dictatorship depended mostly on his charisma.Nasser didn't live a luxurious life or eliminate his earlier comrades after he took over the Egyptian rule. Nasser's single-mindedness in decision-making, however, dominated his leadership. This rare influence depended on an undisputed leadership drawing mainly on Nasser's popularity and charisma.Through a narration covering Nasser's life since his early days, Aburish leaves then his reader to judge whether an incompetent popular leader with no platform was needed at that period of Arab history or not.The book is also a good read for all those who are interested in exploring the history of Egypt and the Arab world between the late 1940s and 1970.In terms of style, Aburish presents an easy going and attractive narrative. His sources and research are, by and large, credible.Certainly several pro-Arab nationalism reviewers will find Aburish's book not credible, but whoever wants to dispute this account should provide a better one instead of employing emotions only in criticizing this work
