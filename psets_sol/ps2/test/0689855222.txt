I was pleasantly surprised with "Pursuit," the latest of the novels derived from the TV series "Roswell." Beginning with a brief explanation of the background and characters for the uninitiated, the authors serve us a well-developed plot that builds on the past exploits of the characters. It is very much an "action" novel, but not without exploring the thoughts, feelings, relationships, and ethical dilemmas of the characters. Having researched their subject extensively, the authors succeed in revealing believable answers to many of the science fictional mysteries left hanging by the TV series. Authors Mangels and Martin deserve a 5 silver handprint rating for writing a book that will make readers want to buy the soon-to-be released sequel, "Turnabout," and maybe even spark interest in the publication of more stories in film and print about the other-worldly young adults
