Dirk Benedict is a witty and 'no holds barred' writer, and I appreciated the raw honesty of both of his books. I read the 1991 printing of this book several years ago and wish I had read it sooner. Confessions changed the way I think about modern medicine. It was the beginning of my journey to learning about the healing power of macrobiotics and it's ability to keep us healthy so we can enjoy life as we were meant to. But don't take my word for it, read the book. I think everyone should.
