I am a student in high school and this book saved me a lot of time and energy while writing a research paper for English. Any part of "A MIdsummer Night's Dream" that I didn't understnad was right there, explained in terms that anyone could understand. It helped me develop my thesis, and overall saved my paper from a certain 'C+' grade. It was a great book
