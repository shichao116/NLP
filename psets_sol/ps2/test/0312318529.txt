I purchased two books, one of them was full of generic non-specific advice, the other thorough and informative, crammed with detailed pointers covering every aspect of a freelance career: The ASJA Guide to Freelance Writing.26 Chapters written by 26 top freelancers - the value of their personal insight and knowledge cannot be downplayed.  I read this book front to back in days, and refer back to it constantly.  Unlike other gimmicky efforts, this book is truly an invaluable resource for beginners and professionals alike
