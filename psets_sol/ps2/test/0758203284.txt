William J. Mann's novels are right at the cutting edge, of literary quality and creativity. His works continue to pack a powerful emotional punch, and are just as much an in-depth exploration of gender roles and sexual identities, as they are domestic sagas that examine the notion of the modern gay sensibility.In All American Boy, Mann expands on the themes of his earlier novels, continuing his journey into the nature of forgiveness, rage, and what it really means to love and be loved. Wally Day, the central protagonist in All American Boy, was once perhaps the archetype of the "American boy," but his downfall was swift and dramatic, and his eventual decent into shame, ignominy, and exile comes at a terrible price.After several years of living in the big city, Wally returns to his hometown of Brown's Mill that is full of the "old tenant housing, row houses built by factory owners for their immigrant workers." Through the abandoned factories he drives, where he finally ends up in the cul-de-sac, the ranch house where he grew up, with the American flag out the front.His mother, Regina is an aging widower, who is steadily deteriorating both physically and mentally. She begs him to come home, realizing that she probably needs him now more than ever. Regina's life has been fraught with unhappiness, loneliness, and disappointment.Her career as a singing star was derailed by the mistakes of her sister Rocky, and then she was thrust into a miss-matched and violent marriage to a brutal and non-caring military man. Life is beginning to catch up with the poor, lonely, and seemingly senile old woman.Her world is unraveling, and plagued with strange, confusing memories of a murder that may or may not have occurred, she turns to the son she barely knows for help. But Walter has remained emotionally distant from his mother. Once upon a time, Wally loved his mother, "more than anything else in his life he loved how soft she was, and how blonde."But Wally realizes that while Brown's Mill may not have changed, and while his mother might not have changed, one important thing had. Once Wally had known all of Brown's Mills secrets. He knew what was hidden where, "which bodies might be found in whatever closet."While Regina battles her own demons, Wally continues to be haunted by the death of Ned. Ned was Wally's one true love, who died of AIDS seven years ago. And while Wally refuses to let go of the hurt, he recalls with fondness, his life as a teenager in Brown's Mill - a life that made him the man he is today.Realizing that he was attracted to men from an early age, Wally sought solace down in the projects of Dog Town, a rambling working class estate, where he met the kindly Miss Aletha - a tall man-woman, who wore a blond wig and purple mascara, and who led a slow paced existence, leisurely strolling through life.When scandal eventually engulfs Wally's family, culminating with his father disowning him, Aletha's group of misfit friends adopts him as one of their own. Given a an erotic charge from watching Saturday Night Fever, "the mean tough handsome guys who wore beautiful, shiny tight fitting clothes, topped off with gold jewelry and hairspray," the thirteen-year-old Wally dabbles in phone sex and eventually meets Zandy, a thirty-year-old hippy with a furry chest and an attitude of pride.Life was all about Zandy and having Zandy satisfy Wally's needs, and in the end, Wally realizes that Zandy has taught him everything about being gay, about our history, our traditions, and not to be ashamed, "you taught me that what I felt wasn't wrong. That I could love and be loved." But it's all too late, because the betrayal, when it comes, is swift and speedy, and in a world of shadows and half-truths that Wally has chosen to live, he ultimately forfeits his place among his peers.Written with layers of metaphor and meaning, and a narrative structure that is complex and multi-layered, All American Boy is a tour-de-force of character and theme, with Mann attempting to explore the political and social climate in which gays and lesbians seek to prosper:  Who's to explain why we do the things we do - why one of us chooses one form of rebellion and another does something else. Who's to say why and how we settle on our own particular method of survival in a predominantly straight world.Alternating between Regina's senile, increasingly fragmentary hold on reality and Wally's seething, resentful reflections, All American Boy gives a startling account of memory, dreams, and the chances and choices that we are sometimes forced to take in life.
