Ace has definitly "been there"; a couple dozen years on and off the street, mental problems (the acid didn't help), and drug abuse makes for some fun reading.   Ace tells of hitchiking to San Francisco's Haight Ashbury district at 17, and not finding "hippie heaven". A realistic look at homelessness; not the romantic side of slumming portrayed by Crimethinc and the like. Ace's analysis of street drugs is dead-on and engaging.
