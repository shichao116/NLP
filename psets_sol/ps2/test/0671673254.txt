This book, hailed as a "classic" by some, really is nothing more than a collection of a single man's speculations regarding the subject matter at hand, body language. There is little-to-no science behind it all, as very little of it is based on solid research. If only a person's nonverbal exhibitions could be read like the words in a book! Sometimes they can, as when you are talking and someone is tapping her foot ferociously. More often than not, however, you cannot. If someone, sitting between two other people, places his crossed leg on top of the other, does this really mean that he likes, knows, or is closer to the person his foot is facing vs. the person his leg is creating a "barrier" against? Of course not! (In fact, this doesn't even make sense to me! I would much rather show the person I know my leg than the bottom of my big shoe!) And so runs many of the claims in this book. Read it, by all means, but keep in mind that many of these claims are rubbish. This is not scientific psychology, but conjecture and speculation much of which will not mesh with your everyday experience of such things
