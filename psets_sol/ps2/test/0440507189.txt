I'm not sure what possessed me to buy this book. I'm certainly past 40 and not in the habit of buying 'self help' books regardless how well credentialed the author is! But buy it I did.It was an eye opener. Once I started reading it, I was compelled to keep on going. There was just enough of those 'ah ha' moments to keep me interested. And enough of those moments when the world goes quiet and seems to take a pause and you know the author is talking just to you!Having said that though, this book is not easy. If you want an easy, uplifting read that will stimulate to change your life, forget it! This book isn't about simply sitting down for a few hours and having a pleasant read. You have to 'get involved', take the tests, do the reflection. Be prepared to be scared!I've got to admit, I didn't do all that stuff, so don't feel I got the most out of the book. I liked the way Barbara Sher admonished me through the course of the book to get with the program. But it didn't work, I just read it for the fun of it and will need to go back and do it properly.If you are serious about evaluating your life now that you've hit 40 (or past 40 for that matter), go for it. Buy the book. Do the exercises and change your life. This book could well be the thing that's starts the journey. Good luck.
