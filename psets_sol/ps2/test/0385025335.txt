I enjoy history and I am a Christian looking to support my faith.  I bought this book for those two reasons.  That said, this book has given me what I was looking for, but not without a cost.  I am motivated don't get me wrong, hey I bought this for "leisure" reading.  That said, I have to work to get up the energy to read this book.  It is a good read, but not an easy read.  It is dry.  That said, it will give you information on the politics, history, religious groups and other information helpful in understanding the context of the new testament.  If you are a casual reader, you have been warned.  This book may sit on your shelf gathering dust..
