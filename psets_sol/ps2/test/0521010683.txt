Don't get into another conversation about the environment until you read this book!  Lomborg explains it all!  He uses easy-to-understand graphs and long time periods to show environmental change.  We have all heard the big numbers-1,000 species extinct every year, seas will be dead in 10 years, rain forest gone in 20.  This book, which should be in every home worldwide, shows how to evaluate the information overload.  Whom should you send your charity to in order to best improve the environment?  Lomborg will show you how to judge.  Which environmental measures save the most lives for the least money?  Lomborg assembles the data.As a former CPA, I became disillusioned when I realized non-profit environmental organizations were just as selfish as any other business.  When human self-interest is at stake, objectivity goes out the window.  So this book was the answer to a prayer for me.  A way to measure where we are on air, water, extinctions, population, disease and global warming.  Where will you get the most bang for your buck and volunteer hours?  First you have to know how bad things are and what the remedies might be.Make no mistake, this is not easy reading; it is, however, essential reading for every voter and activist on the planet.READ THIS BOOK!!!!
