Henry IV remains one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, even though the tragedies and comedies get far more attention and seeming appreciation than do the histories. As an English major, I examined Henry's (Hal's) character, and I focused on his development from a somewhat foolhardy young man into a self-assured, even manipulative prince. It is hard to say which of these Hal truly is, or if he is a little bit of both.At the beginning of the play, Hal spends his free time cavorting around with his friend Falstaff (who provides all of the laughs in the play and is cited as one of the best comic characters in all literature). In the first act we already see hints in Hal's sololiquy that he may not be as carefree as we are led to believe, and that he might betray friends like Falstaff to be the prince that he is expected to be. Read on in &quot;Henry V&quot; to see just how much of a polished politician Hal becomes--his battle cries and his &quot;once more unto the breech, dear friends&quot; is masterful in its persuasiveness and ability to induce his countrymen to fight.Hotspur serves as a nice counterpoint to Hal in &quot;Henry IV.&quot; Hotspur is the hothead and Hal makes his decisions calmly and rationally. This almost inhuman rationality comes into play again in &quot;Henry V&quot; and makes you long for the seemingly carefree Hal.All in all, &quot;Henry IV&quot; is a great read and quite an interesting character study--I highly recommend it
