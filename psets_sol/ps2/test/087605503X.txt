Indeed,this book is about the best I've read on the subject thus far and is well balanced. I would have given FIVE stars however one thing perturbed me no end! This book contains the SAME information as THE ESSENTIAL AUSTRALIAN SHEPHERD and is mostly verbatim!  The two books have entirely different titles,the author of one is not listed on the cover of the other,the publishers seem to be different and the dates of publication are different. Any reasonably intelligent ,trusting person would assume they were different books! Caveat emptor. I purchased both books,paid twice and about the only difference between them was one was hardcover and one was paperback...oh,and though the content inside was almost exactly the same,the covers were very different for some odd reason. I would search the library next time
