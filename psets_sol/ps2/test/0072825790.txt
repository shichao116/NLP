Schwalbe's concept of "Sociological Mindfulness" - or basically, how to be a good and socially responsible person - is heavily filtered through his liberal ideaological views. He tells us in the book's very first chapter that calling him a liberal is meaningless, because labels in themselves are meaningless. Sure, throwing around labels like "Liberal" or "Conservative" is not only weak, but cliche. However, when you're writing a book that is essentially a guide to living in and improving society, you definitely lose some credibility for being clearly biased politically.I don't identify myself at all as a conservative, as I'm pretty liberal myself (possibly even more liberal than Schwalbe that condemns anyone producing or supporting pornography as being responsible ultimately for only misery, and lumps that specific industry in with big tobacco and gun manufacturers), but that doesn't mean I support someone shoveling a political agenda and calling it social science
