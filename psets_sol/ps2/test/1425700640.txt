I was very disapointed with this book.  First it is a self published book that needs to be proof read and the font selected is horrid and hard to read.  Secondly, this is Stringfellow's soap box about her ex husband and work troubles.  It kept sounding like she was taking revenge on these people with her words, it just didn't set well with me.  The part that she did talk about Faith the dog, she really didn't go into any great detail.  Pass on this book and get Grim's book about Quentien, the dog who survived the gas chamber, its a much better read
