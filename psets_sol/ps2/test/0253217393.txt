I disagree vehemently with the above review. I will grant that the book gets preachy at times. I will also refer potential readers and reviewers to the title of the book in forming their expectations. The book is about music education in the bigger picture, and the role played by music educators and students. At times it gets incendiary. That's a good thing. It's supposed to. It wants you to get beyond getting a "1" at festival into what else you have or should have to offer as a music teacher. I also have the advantage of having met Paul in a small informal setting and hearing him explain his views. If you want hard core philosophy go for Reimer, Jorgensen and that crew. Just looking at the title willl give you proper expectations. Finally, if you voted for George Bush, don't bother with this
