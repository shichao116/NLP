I haven't read Flexner's 3 volume biography on George Washington, so I can't compare the two, but I CAN tell you that with limited amount of reading time available I didn't want to start out with 3 volumes.I also wanted a reasonably comprehensive look at the man with so many things named after him.  Of all the founding Fathers President/General Washington seemed one of the most ethereal, least concrete figures of all.  The earthy and witty Benjamin Franklin and the enigmatic Thomas Jefferson seem relatively easy to "know" in comparison.Flexner produces a man who stood shoulders above the other Giants at the founding of the United States.  Not nearly as well-educated as Jefferson, Franklin or John Adams, and with a military tactician's ability that seemed rudimentary, he nonetheless had an aura of a man who seemed incapable of doing anything other than the "right thing".  When the Continental Congress was choosing a General to lead the Army, no one other than Washington was seriously considered.  When the Continental Convention was called, initially only to revise the weak Articles of Confederation, there was no other choice to preside over the convention.  Initially he hadn't seriously considered GOING to the Constitutional Convention, but Benjamin Franklin - older and wiser - recognized that Washington MUST go to the convention or it would not be recognized as having authority.  After the Constitution was written and ratified Washington had the easiest Presidential campaign ever - all he had to do was not decline the office.We get a view of Washington the man as well: the woman he truly loved who he didn't get to marry,  his wrong decisions in early military campaigns, his distaste for developing "party politics".It would be difficult to imagine a single volume biography on this Great American superior to this one.
