I love this book. I have read many many books on Pluto, being a Plutonian myself, and have found Cunningham's interpretation easy to grasp, written with care and compassion, and very straight-forward. Cunningham doesn't get overly flowery or diverge from the topic at hand. this is a great book no matter your level of astrology. I find her writing style in general is written for the masses, but with Cunningham it is an asset.the book is sectioned in a general over-view of what defines a Plutonian type (someone with a very active Pluto in their natal chart or going through a major Pluto transit), touching on diverse topics as sex, relationships, power, violence, and abuse. Also discussed in somewhat "cookbook" style is the specific applications of Pluto in the natal chart and the natal placement and aspects. here, it would have been great if she got even more specific (instead of lumping house and sign placements together, it would have been great to discuss what house placements on there own mean, or specific aspects in a natal chart mean to the Plutonian) , but her efforts are sufficient.  She then goes into specific meditations and bach flower remedies that facilitate healing and evolution beyond the lower vibrations of Pluto. Specific transits to natal planets and their lessons are next. 1 chapter is dedicated to the issue of abuse and incest. the author acknowledges that this part of her book is not easy to read, but as a counselor she brings great insight to the subject. throughout her book, the author not only addresses the potential for the "lower manifestations" of Pluto aspects, but she emphasizes the potential to evolve and heal. the higher, more positive aspects of Pluto aspects get their fair mention.Beautifully and simply written, worth many re-reads. Of all my Pluto books, this is the one I recommend to others most and refer to again and again.
