I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken.  About half this book described the history of Iraq.  The actual war coverage was broad and brief.  This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books.  John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment
