Like A. Abruzzese, I too did not know of The Gilroy Garlic Festival.  So I just had to buy the book because as my dad has told me, "It's just like being there.""Kelly's Asian Chicken, People Always Ask For This Recipe Party Dip, Whole Garlic Appetizer, Spicy Garlic Chicken, Bob's Garlic Chicken, Susie Townsend's Ex-Husband's Sesame Broccoli Pasta Salad Significantly Improved, Indonesian Chicken With Green Beans And Garlic, Garlic Chicken A L'Orange" were all winners for my husband and myself.If you are a "garlic head" you have to get this book!
