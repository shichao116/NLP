The book starts out well enough when banker Ben Hartman, in Switzerland on business, runs into an old college buddy who tries to kill him.  Then through a series of accidental discoveries, narrow escapes, and unbelievable coincidences, Hartman learns that practically everybody he knows, and everyone new he meets, is involved in an evil cabal bent on world domination.When you finally find out who the criminal mastermind is, it seems like something only Austin Powers' nemesis Dr. Evil could have pulled off.  Without giving too much away - I have to say that the ending involves the hero attempting a daring rescue from the villain's heavily-guarded, secret mountain lair.  And of course there is a scene where the villain feels the need to carry on a long monologue to explain his evil plot to the hero.  Yeah baby, yeah
