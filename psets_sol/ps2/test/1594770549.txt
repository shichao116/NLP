This is by far the best manual I have ever used for my fibromyalgia/myofascial pain. It gives instructions for the physical therapist as well as helping the patient with identifying the location of the problem. Excellent diagrams help you to locate the areas to massage or use accupressure on for relief of pain. The book then gives stretching and strengthening moves for each specific area. For the last ten years I had an area of severe pain that neither I nor my therapist could figure out how to relieve. The first time through this manual, I was able to identify the exact spots to manipulate and I had immediate relief. It is worth 10 times what I paid for that one thing alone. I am VERY happy with this book
