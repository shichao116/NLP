Portuguese Irregular Verbs (2003) is the first in a new humor series.  Professor Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld is a professional philologist, author of the 1200 page volume of the title, but having high interest in most languages.  His closest friends/colleagues are also philologists and very German.  This book contains eight tales of their social bumbles.In this novel, we learn of Igelfeld's attempt to play tennis with Professor Dr Dr (hc) Florianus Prinzel while Professor Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer functions as umpire.  None had played the game before, but they are provided with an (out of date) book by the management.  They play by the rules in the book, but the server loses every game and no one gains the necessary two game lead to win.  Did I explain that this trio is German?After eventual exhaustion, they go for a swim.  None had swum before.  A good time is had by all of the onlookers, but not by Igelfeld and friends.As a student at Heidelberg, Igelfeld admires Prinzel and brags of his athletic prowess.  In fact, Prinzel has no athletic skills whatsoever.  Then Igelfeld gets Prinzel into a duel with a scarfaced student.After obtaining his doctorate, Igelfeld finds a posting as assistant to Professor Dr Vogelsang in Munich.  Although Vogelsang has some flaws -- notably the publishing of Igelfeld's work under Vogelsang's name -- Igelfeld does enjoy the thought of fieldwork in Ireland.  However, their trip only results in a compendium of Gaelic curse words.  Then Igelfeld loses his boarding when his landlady finds the papers in his room.Moving on to a second assistantship with Professor Walter Schoeffer-Henscel at Wiesbaden, Igelfeld serves long and faithfully and eventually receives a chair in the Institute with Prinzel and Unterholzer.  Attending a philology conference in Siena, Igelfeld leaves early to visit Montalcino. There he encounters a xenophobic innkeeper.On a visit to Goa for a philological conference, Igelfeld finds that the governor of the local prison is a murderer as well as a highly respected member of the community.  He also encounters a Holy man, who makes certain prophecies about his life.  Igelfeld decides to return to the institute post haste.Later he makes an effort to expand the market for his large tome -- Portuguese Irregular Verbs -- and visits Unterholzer to determine whether his colleague has a copy of the work.  Encountering certain evidence of social aggrandisement, Igelfeld criticizes Unterholter's taste in decoration only after determining that his colleague does not have a copy in the study.  But he reverses this attitude immediately after he discovers *two* copies within a bookcase in the hallway.Then Igelfeld falls in love with his dentist, but fails to act upon this feeling with precipitous haste.  He considers his duty as a von Igelfeld and the social implications thereof.  Meanwhile, she marries another.Of course, there is the great concern for what name to use with other people.  During his fieldwork in Ireland, Dr. Patrick Fitzcarron O'Leary, his host, calls him "Maria" and later "von", which thoroughly confuses Igelfeld.  Later O'Leary calls a barman Paddy, so Igelfeld knows how to reply when asked what he will have.  But the men at the bar call O'Leary various nicknames -- i.e., Fritz, Pat and O -- and Igelfeld decides that the Irish are beyond his comprehension.In this novel, Igelfeld seems to have *all* the alleged flaws of the German upper caste.  Of course, he is really Austrian, but what difference does that make?  He is determined to act as a proper Prussian gentleman.Highly recommended for fans of McCall Smith and for anyone else who enjoys tales of proper Prussian gentlemen and the social traps they encounter.-Bill Jordin
