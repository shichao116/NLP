In this 5th. book of the series, the opera-loving priest, Father John, again teams up with Vicki Holden, an Arapaho attorney, to solve a crime and right the wrongs on the Wind River Reservation.  The problems start when a priest who had been at the mission on the reservation several years ago, returns and is murdered.  At the same time, two women who are searching for their identity come back to the reservation.  One of them is a movie star who has been adopted and who feels that she was born on the Arapaho reservation.  The other is Father John's niece who comes to him with questions about her paternity.  There is the usual tension and undeniable attraction between Father John and Vicki, and also the presence of Vicki's ex-husband Ben to contend with.  This is a good read and will please Margaret Coel fans
