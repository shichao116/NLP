Joey Hill has an incredible gift for telling the heartwrenching story of dmaged souls who find redemption through their love. For Mark and Nicole this means making an unrestricted commitment to each other., Nicole finds this much easier, although she is the shy partner in the relationship. Mark has lost his ability to trust. At all. To read how Nicole convinces himself of what they can have together, how he tests her, pushes her, until he realizes what a gift she is to him, is a wonderful journey. As with the Ice Queen/Mirror of My Soul combination, I dare the reader to finish this story with dry eyes. Do not miss this novel. It's a Must Buy
