I checked this book out of the library after a discussion with friends of American knowledge of the impending extermination of Jews in America after watching &quot;Schindler's List.&quot; At page 68 of 400 I had to throw the  book down in tears. I'm not sure if I can bear to read any further. At this  point I am absolutely ashamed to be an American or have been affiliated  with the Allies not only because of the utter apathy because of our own  &quot;interests&quot; but also for the shameful disregard for countless  first-hand pleas of help of Jews on their plight to  &quot;resettlements&quot; and &quot;reservations.&quot; Shame on fellow  Christians. Shame on the entire United States Government. Shame on the  entire British Government. Shame on the Allies. God help us. Fearfully the  common cliche comes to mind: &quot;The only thing we learn from history is  that we don't learn from history.&quot; What else can be said? Perhaps you  can get farther in this book than I have
