Sorry to read that some people didn't like this book.  As with all the books about Emma Harte's family, I loved it.  One gets to know the family well.  They are undeniably wealthy English folk, who have a large, complex family.  When Ms. Taylor-Bradford writes about them, she purposely lets us read about the elaborate homes, the clothes, the ultra fashion of the family.  That's just all part of it.  I feel as though I am "right there," and I love her detail to the intricate dealings of this complex family.  If one really wants to do this book justice, however, all of the books about Emma Harte and her family should be read in sequence.  It then makes every so much more sense
