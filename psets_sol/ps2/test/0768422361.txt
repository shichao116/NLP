Most Christians have no idea what really happened in the first-century church. In fact, we have many misconceptions about the early church because our approach to the New Testament is misguided.The reason for this is simple, yet mostly unknown. The books of the New Testament are not arranged in chronological order! Paul's letters, for instance, which make up most of the New Testament, are arranged according to size instead of chronologically. Therefore, it's difficult to know what happened when because we don't read our New Testaments chronologically. To put it another way, we simply don't know "the story" of the first-century church because we have never read it in its historical order.Further, because our New Testament is not in chronological order, we cannot understand the letters from the perspective of the people who received them. Nor from the perspective of those who wrote them. We are ignorant of the cultural, the social, and the political environment behind the New Testament books. Instead, we learn chapters and verses, out of context. This is one reason why there are so many divisions in the church today. It is because anyone can prove any doctrine or practice by cutting and pasting verses together when they are lifted out of their historical, chronological context.There is now a remedy for this. Frank Viola has written a masterful New Testament handbook that puts the entire first-century story together in an understandable way. In, The Untold Story of the New Testament Church, Frank takes all the New Testament books and puts them in their proper chronological order. He then "fills in" all the historical details behind each book, giving us a complete picture of what really happened in the first century. The book of Acts is weaved together with all of the New Testament letters, giving us a first-hand "you-are-there" narrative of the entire saga of the early church. The book includes maps, dates, and much more. After reading you feel as if you were transported back in time. Now each NT book comes alive, you understand what is going on, why Paul or James or Peter is writing these letters.This book revolutionized my understanding of the New Testament, and I believe it will do the same for all who read it! We have used this book as a family reading through it from cover to cover. The book has the NT books listed in their order and we at each point stop and read that NT book from chapter to chapter. We have thoroughly enjoyed reading the NT using the book as a handbook
