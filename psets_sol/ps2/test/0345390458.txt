Although in resolving the fates of some characters from his past novels Smith made a few "mistakes" here in Havana Bay, this is beyond a doubt one heck of an enjoyable read. As always, these Renko novels are not only mysteries or crime stories but also function as adept sociological studies of the societies in which they are set. In this case, Renko, once the most brilliant investigator in Communist-era Moscow, finds himself in Havana, Cuba, at a time when Russians are not only unwelcome, but hated after their financial pullout from Cuba is regarded as a deep betrayal of the previously close relationship the two Marxist nations enjoyed. Renko seeks answers on this tumultuous Caribbean island. Is a body found floating in Havana Bay truly that of the KGB officer whose personal intervention saved his life during the events covered in the novel Gorky Park? And if it is, was the man's death an accident, or murder? And why exactly was an agent of the defunct KGB in Cuba at all? Smith explores post-Cold War Cuban society with the same degree of careful (and coldly honest) evaluation that has always distinguished his novels from those of his many imitators. Cuba, stricken with shame at its status as a stopover point for rich Europeans undertaking "sexual tourism" is a nation teetering on collapse. Run by an anachronistic god-like dictator, impoverished and growing moreso by the month, this island nation that exported Marxist ideology so proudly in days gone by is by the time of Renko's visit teeming with plots, scandals, and bloody crime waves. Perhaps in no other volume of this quartet of novels has the main character, Arkady Renko, faced dangers so unrelenting.
