This book was perhaps intended first for vocational school students who will become electricians, but our small professional engineering firm has used it for more than a decade as a self-study professional development course for young mechanical and electrical engineers with design responsibilities for building HVAC systems. We just bought five copies of this latest edition.The twenty-one units average sixteen pages each and cover all topics needed to calculate and layout the design of a small commercial building. The book even includes a complete set of ten architectural and electrical drawings, so the reader can see what a completed electrical design looks like when ready for contractor bids. It's all here - from the branch circuits for receptacles, HVAC motors, and lighting through the panelboards, and electrical service.The book has several hundred illustrations, charts, and tables and detailed references to the National Electrical Code.The author is a licensed electrician and teacher. His coauthor is a professional engineer and professor.
