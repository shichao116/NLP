Oscar Acosta's works stand on their own, give a unique perspective, and cover important topics. It's a given that most HST fans will also like Acosta, but even readers who aren't familiar with or (perish the thought) aren't fond of the good Dr's works may still like Acosta's frank (and not ostensibly exaggerated) depictions of his life as a chicano civil rights lawyer in the 1960's
