On a cold morning in February three men waiting their turn to appear before a criminal court judge find themselves locked down in one room while every lawman in the vicinity searches for a fourth convict, who has escaped. As time passes, the men discuss why they are there. Channing claims he's been mistaken for another C.A.Channing and will be released; Lowell was arrested for stalking; and Giordano is appealing his sentence for killing his wife and children because the detective lied in court. To while away the time, these three violent men play a 'pretend' game, naming three people they would like to kill if they knew they wouldn't be caught. Channing is released and Giordano and Lowell return to jail to wait for their time in court.The suspense in DEAD WRONG is not who-done-it; since readers have a prologue that sets up the story, an advantage our leading characters do not have. The mystery of why women named Mary Douglas are being murdered baffles law enforcement and profilers are called in to help solve the case. When the third woman named Mary Douglas falls victim to another heinous crime, detectives deduce they are being killed in the order they appear in the phone book; M. J. Douglas is next on the list. Her sister Annie McCall, an FBI agent, and colleague Miranda Cahill (fans will remember her from a previous story) warn Mara to take extra precautions as they believe she is the next victim. Annie doesn't stop with the warning; she calls in a favor from another agent who is on medical leave.Aiden Shields and his brother Dylan were undercover agents setting up a big drug sting that turned bad, leaving Dylan dead and Aiden badly wounded. He hasn't recovered from the shooting or the psychological wounds and feels guilty for not saving his brother. He's on leave from the FBI and doesn't believe he will ever be able to pass a physical exam to return to the force in any capacity. He's at about the lowest a man can be when Annie tells him she needs him to guard and protect her sister. Annie was Dylan's girlfriend and Aiden can't refuse her anything, so reluctantly he packs up his bag and heads for the Douglas home, where he is anything but welcomed by Mara Douglas.DEAD WRONG is the first in a trilogy and a thriller to hold you entranced - if that is even the right word for what you will be as you read this one.
