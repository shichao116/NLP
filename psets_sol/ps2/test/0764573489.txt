This is an excellent book as the instructions are written in a clear concise format.  Recipes include a variety of desserts--cakes, cookies, breads, and special occasion cakes for birthday, Christmas, and other holidays.  Even the novice cook would benefit from this cookbook as I believe these are "never fail" recipes which is a good boost to the beginning baker!  Tips are also given at the beginning of the book to make sure the baker has all the information he/she needs as well as a consumer Q & A section is given
