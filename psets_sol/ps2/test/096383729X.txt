Hello,In Feb '06, my mother was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. That diagnosis resulted in the removal of the tumor in her colon, 40% of her liver, and overaries. She began chemo in April '06 and followed the advice from this book and other sources of what you should do to stengthen your body to fight off the cancer and potential side effects of chemo. She's been such a fighter, blending and drinking her own vegetable juices (carrots, kale, broccoli), drinking wheat grass shots, avoiding sugar, eating whole grains, taking supplements, vitamins (Immunopower 3.0) and praying. She just finished her 6th chemo session yesterday and she feels and looks great. Not only did she return back to her full-time job during session 2, she didn't lose her hair, nails, develope mouth sores or get dry skin. To her surprise as well as mine, her nails have never been so strong as they are now. Even her doctor's are surprised how strong her blood work is. By session 6, her white blood count is suppose to be low but instead hers are very strong. I am not sure what the future holds but I do believe GOD's help can be found in the right food! DARK GREEN VEGGIES SUCH AS BROCCOLI!!!
