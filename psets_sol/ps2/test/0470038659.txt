This book takes 10 biases, explains their reasoning and gives quantitative back-up for how each does in a Tradestation simulated back-test.  Art is a successful mechanical trader so you get a look into how he thinks and how he interprets the results.  Each bias is relatively simple and demonstrated to have a small but definable edge across multiple markets.The aspect to this book that is most interesting is how to integrate these various small biases into a master composite 'index'.  As Bob Pardo writes in the Foreward section of this book "indexing can be very powerful... It can be a very effective way to 'summarize' large amounts of complex information."I find that if I can take just 1 or 2 practical ideas from a book, it is a good book.  This book did more than that -- it got me started on 'indexing' for individual stock lists and sparking new directions for me.  I highly recommend this book to anyone -- but especially those with some kind of competence in quantitative methods to trading.
