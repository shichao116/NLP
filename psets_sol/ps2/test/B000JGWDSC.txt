This cookbook is a delight!  Wonderful, tasteful Italian receipes that are simple enough for the non-gourmet cook to prepare, but as tasty as a meal prepared by a gourmand.  It is organized in that wonderful European style of simple, easy to access design.  For a wedding gift,a holiday surprise for a friend, or a fun, joint project for a couple who loves good food at home, this is the one.  T.White-Kansas Cit
