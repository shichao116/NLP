A strong collection of short fiction that is overwhelmed by the  anchor: &quot;You Cheated, You Lied.&quot; I think that Jones took a superman pill before writing that one. Probably, it is more recent than the other  stories. The female lead is mesmerizing. She reminds me of Balzac's young  actress, Coralie. Thank God that Jones had the strength of character to  keep her alive. A writing coach would have killed her off mercilessly, but  the story would have suffered. She is the woman that all the other  characters from the other stories need so much. I do not know why Jones  choose to bestow her on the somewhat diaphonous Will'am, nor do I care. The  story, qua stort story, is nearly perfect
