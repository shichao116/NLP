John D'Emilio is a celebrated gay academic who wrote about gay issues when scholars were too afraid to risk their chances for tenure to do so.  He is just as brave as George Chauncey and Esther Newton, gay academics who fought for the right to do gay scholarship.  This book is a smorgasbord of his essays.  It includes his groundbreaking piece "Capitalism and Gay Identity."  It also has an awesome chapter where D'Emilio critiques anti-porn feminist activism.  This book would be easy for non-academic readers to peruse as well.  I would recommend this and all of D'Emilio's books
