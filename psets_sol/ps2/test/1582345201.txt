The most striking thing about this book isn't the age of the author, or even his unique perspective, returning to Afghanistan after September 11, having been raised in California. The most striking thing about this book is that, by the time you have finished reading it, you will care very deeply about what has happened, and IS happening, in Afghanistan. At times very touching and sad, and at other times very funny, this is a very moving, emotionally-charged and honest book.
