I loved this book.  Like another reviewer, my parents never talked with me about sex.  Unlike the other viewer, however, I found this book very helpful.  I was so scared to have "The Big Talk" with my children, because I had no idea what to say.  When I read this book, I was able to relax about the conversation, and let things come naturally.  I'm no longer scared about my children asking questions, because now I have answers.
