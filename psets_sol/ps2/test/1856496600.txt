This would be one of the few truly objective accounts of politics and ethnic insurgence in Myanmar/Burma. So many books on this country are biased by emotion and ambulance vehicles for the strong marketing of the democratic movement. This one stands out above all the latter. Having spent considerable time in Myanmar/Burma researching its modern history, I would have to say that Smith gives the most in depth, accurate and objective account. This book is a must for anyone who is interested in the political modern history of Burma/Myanmar
