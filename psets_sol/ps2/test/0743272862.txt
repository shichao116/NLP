Throw away your Good Housekeeping Guides, the Hints from Heloise, and the handwritten notes on how to remove stains. This is the one book to own if you want to know everything about cleaning, organizing, maintaining and caring for a home. Cooking, cleaning, caring for cloth, furniture, floors, walls...just everything. Huge and wonderful, this should be the first thing you pull off the shelf when pondering how to do something in the home - even how to handle domestic help. Highly, highly recommended
