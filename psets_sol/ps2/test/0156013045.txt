A great read off the back of a sports journalist's life experience among both the baseball and sports writer's fraternity. Some great quotes and stories from hall-of-fame pitchers, and the pioneers of the modern game. Not just for those who like pitching, but a great book for all baseball fans who want to hear about spending a life studying the players and the game, and written by a well educated person who has spent his life writing about baseball without the ego of a player talking about himself
