Ok to sum it up, if you want to learn jsf from scratch, stay away from it. If you know you way around JSF and want to dive into the the rather complex materia of how to write JSF components, this book is a must buy, there simply is no other book which does the coverage of this topic as extensive as this one.I  have been programming JSF components for almost a year now and still lots of the covered subjects have been new to me. The wealth of information this book gives is simply amazing. Five stars for this one. A must buy
