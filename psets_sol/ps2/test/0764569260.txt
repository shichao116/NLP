OK, I'll admit I always wondered what it is about catnip that gives a  'high' to cats, and now I know.  This very enjoyable collection of cat tidbits explains catnip, purring, 'kneading' and other cat phenomena.  The section dealing with myths and legends about cats is really fascinating.  I never knew there were so many wild (and dangerous) misconceptions about cats.  I also never knew that so many famous people through history were cat lovers--including Cleopatra, Winston Churchill, and Mark Twain.  I'm writing this before Christmas, so I'm remembering the wonderful legend connecting the Nativity with the 'M' on the foreheads of tabby cats.  I wish this book had better illustrations, frankly, but that is a minor point since it is a good read and a good stocking stuffer for any cat lover that is hard to buy for
