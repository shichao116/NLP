This is a city full of history and the Encyclopedia of Chicago did an okay job with it. True I wish there was more about Mayors Richard J. and Richard M Daley, the book was interesting to read.It gives you a sense of life in this great city. Thanks neverthless to the Chicago Historical Society and the Newberry Library for their effort
