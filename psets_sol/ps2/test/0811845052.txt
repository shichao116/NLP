Okay, maybe No Plot, No Problem didn't actually change my life, but thanks to Chris Baty, I'm now closer to being the published writer I've always wanted to be than ever.All my life, I've lived with the thought, "Some day I want to be a writer", but all I had to show for it were a few short stories and a bunch of novels that didn't go farther than the first 20 or 30 pages.  Then I learned about Nanowrimo (National Novel Writing Month).  Here was a chance for me to break through my shortcomings, overcome my fears, and produce something.  I learned that it didn't matter how great or crappy my novel was as long as I put it down on paper.So, once I was on board with writing a 50,000 word novel in a month, I decided to check out this book.  It helped me because it gave me tips and advice as well as encouragement to keep me going.  There's some stuff in this book that may seem cheesy (like the "take my inner editor, please" button), but it was exactly what I needed to cast all my worries aside and have fun with it.While it's true that at the end of the month you'll have a rough draft that will probably need a lot of work to make publishable, it's still more than you would have had if you hadn't spent the month writing like a madman.  You can take comfort in knowing that you have probably been more productive in that one month's time than you have in the six months prior.  The point isn't to create that wonderful masterpiece that will win you fame and make you rich.  The point is to practice the skill of writing so that in time you'll be a better writer
