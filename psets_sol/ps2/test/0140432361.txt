Pater was one of the most insightful and exacting critics of England, and his fiction exceeded even his own standards for beauty.  Marius the Epicurean is the story of a young man's spiritual and aesthetic awakening  in ancient Rome.  He journeys from Stoicism to Cyrenaicism to Epicureanism,  and finally to Christianity. The book is subtle and profound, and is  written in Pater's characteristically lovely prose.  I do not recommend  this book to anyone who wants a traditional linear plot in which the  protagonist is motivated by external events; rather, I recommend it to all  who wish &quot;to burn with a hard, gemlike flame,&quot; to all who make  careful aesthetic contemplation their highest goal
