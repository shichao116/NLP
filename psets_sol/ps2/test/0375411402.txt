Enjoying Bright Lights, Big City (20 years ago), and after seeing decent reviews for this, I looked forward to reading the Good Life.On the positive side, it was a quick read, whose soap opera story lines (that's the guilty part)and sound storytelling keeps you involved and pushing forward. But, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, it becomes played out as a modern version of the Great Gatsby where the shallow characters become people you could care less about, and the dialog between those characters becomes increasingly abysmal. If you do read it, the telephone exchanges between the two primary characters is particularly painful.
