To settle a dispute over the ownership of a land, a large legal firm approaches Animators, Inc. Their request is very specific: raise the corpses and determine which family is the rightful owners. It sounds rather easy except that the corpses are at least two-hundred-years old; a job that only the best animator could possibly do.Enter our heroine Anita Blake. As usual, it wouldn't be a normal day for her if she only had one problem to deal with. While inspecting the land, she gets a call from the police asking for her opinion on three gruesome murders. However, it doesn't stop there. Shortly after, she is called to investigate the murder of a dead girl who was obviously slain by a vampire. In just a few hours in Branson, Missouri, Anita realizes that they are dealing with something more sinister; something that would require the help of the Master of the City--her boyfriend, Jean-Claude.Welcome to the world of Anita Blake--animator, necromancer and vampire-slayer extraordinaire. She is tough, cynical, and witty, and possesses a warped sense of humor. While she is ruthless when it comes to annihilating the monsters, you just can't help but love her. Hamilton has created such a fantastic character and storyline that one can't help but be enticed and be drawn into Anita's world. She knows how to blend mystery, supernatural theme, romance and humor. She also has a real talent for seducing the readers by giving just enough hints of what to expect in the future, such as revealing a teeny weenie bit more about Anita's real powers or divulging something interesting about the other central characters, or taking her relationship with Jean-Claude one step further, just enough to whet your appetite. And it works! Because if it doesn't, I wouldn't be reaching for the next book as soon as I get to the last page of one.BLOODY BONES is the fifth book in the series. While this volume can stand alone, it is worth reading the first four books to give you a richer understanding of the characters and their lives
