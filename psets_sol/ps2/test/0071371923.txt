This is really good starter book. I liked the way Scott  explained the variables and other memory structure stuff. However, there are some mistakes. THis program line for Basic Stamp 2 reads: debug &quot;Go!&quot;, cr and there is no explanation what is the purpose of cr. Another line reads: debug DEC dogAge, &quot; dog years&quot; and no explanation on what DEC stands for. Small things like this can be big obstacle for novice
