Stanely Booth does an excellent job writing about the Stones from their early humble beginnings to 1969 at the Alamount Speedway.  Not only did he travel one-one with the band members he also travelled around England and interviewed Brian Jones' parents and the Stones long-time roadie Ian Stewart. You learn about their beginnings and Brian Jones' demise. Having travelled and 'hung out' with the band he paints a vivid picture of the day-to-day lifestyle of the Stones and the culture of 1960's.  It's not a book filled with endless stories about groupies and partying (there are some) but rather a 360 degree look at the band. Also a frightening eye-witness account of the murders and chaos at Alamount Speedway.Would recommended to anybody interested in the Rolling Stones, Brian Jones, Alamount or just the 1960's in general.  Very good.
