Iris Murdoch's books aren't for everyone: they are for sensitive, intellectual, and introspective readers. I read this one a few months ago, and was very impressed with the quality of the writing, the complexity of  the characters' personalities, and the pervasive exploration of their  different viewpoints and feelings as the story unfolds. Not only is this  book intelligent and insightful, it is also entertaining, and never  slow-going. My only criticism concerns the two somewhat  &quot;fabulous&quot; accidents which take place near the end. An excellent  novel nevertheless
