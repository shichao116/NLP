At the top of the "Who's Who in Self-Publishing" list you will find Dan Poynter's name. And right next to it you might find information about The Self-Publishing Manual, now in its 15th edition, fully revised to recognize the rapid changes in the industry.The Self-Publishing Manual has become the modern day bible for writers considering independent publishing. It is filled with prophecies, prophets, and yes, even a miracle or two! But the Self-Publishing Manual does more than strategically gloss the surface as so many other similarly-themed books do. Instead, it delves into the logistics of planning, printing, publishing, distributing, shipping, and invoicing a self-published book, going over each detail with a fine-tooth comb as only a 430 page tome can. The Self-Publishing Manual takes no prisoners in shedding light on one simple fact: Self-publishing a book is not for everyone. It is hard work that requires the hands of a craftsman, the brain of a project manager, and the heart of an entrepreneur. This book will help you decide if self-publishing is right for you, or if another publishing alternative is a better fit for your goals.Any resource guide filled with so much information is bound to motivate a writer to continue striving for the exciting status of publication. It becomes a matter of absorbing enough information and doing enough research about all the available publishing options to make the right decision. Not all authors are destined for Random House, but that doesn't mean they have to go on being unpublished.  There are alternatives! And this book covers one alternative, independent self-publishing, with finely crafted finesse. - Brent Sampson, author of Self-Publishing Simplified
