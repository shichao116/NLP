Am a fan of Lowenstein's books. Read Buffett (5 stars) and When Genius Failed (4.5 stars) ... so I was drawn to this book more from his past successes than a desire to read up on the crash of 2000 ...Overall, it's a good recap of events and a good probing of the reasons, details, nuances, etc.; but I felt that it was more of a retelling of events that a person would be highly familiar with simply by having read the Wall Street Journal on a daily basis ... I didn't read much on Enron so the book's details shed good insights ... but again, if I had read most of the Enron articles from its heyday, I probably would have been familiar with most of what the author reveals in his book ...So I give this book 4 stars ... good recap ... for someone who is highly interested in the reasons behind the crash and "did not read the WSJ on a daily basis", then this book will provide a superb backdrop to the financial fiasco that began the new millenium ...
