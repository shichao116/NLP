I'm a student at the same university this author is affiliated with, and I was lucky enough to have a teacher require this book. The short stories were great, but I must say that I enjoyed the chapters the most. There is so much information within confines of those two paperback covers. There's so much to learn from the little subsections. I learned quite a bit about writing.The most helpful chapter, I think, was Chapter 1 Whatever Works: The Writing Process. It gives a bunch of hints about how to get the creative juices flowing and other random advice that no one thinks to give aspiring writers. There's a chapter that covers just about everything. Another great topic was actually broken into two chapters. The sections on characterization (Chapters 4 and 5) were also extremely helpful
