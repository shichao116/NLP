This CD is great!  I love that it has the words as well as the chords...........if you choose to play along.  My daughter is 5 1/2 months old and loves to listen to this CD.  They've also incorporated kids into it so it's just adorable.  This is something I can listen to for a while and I know my daughter will enjoy it for years to come.  I highly recommend this for price & value.
