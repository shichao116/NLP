It is a compelling book about one of this country's greatest politicians. One can not help but compare President Lincoln to leaders in our lifetime.  Lincoln was vilified, denounced as a buffoon, and called incompetent by his rivals for office.  Yet they were defeated.He was considered a novice among leaders, with limited experience.  Yet he led his cabinet and country with skills that were unparallel through the most tumultuous times in our history.They called him a backwoods lawyer with limited communicative skills.  Yet he became one of the most eloquent speakers in our history.I learned and was reminded of many lessons while reading this monumental piece of American history.  One lesson is that people can live up to levels of expectation created within themselves. I recommend this book as a definitive guide for anyone in a leadership position and for all who have been told at some point in their lives; "It  can't be done!"Reginald V.
