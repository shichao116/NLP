The 1986 Mets were truly a special team for me. Jeff Perlman's "The Bad Guys Won!" captures all the magic and excitement of that magnificent team and year. I think Jeff may be correct in his thesis that the 1986 Mets represented the end of an era in baseball - that today's players and teams "lack the fire and panache of yesteryear."Perlman does a fantastic job retelling the tale of "brawling, boozing, bimbo chasing" 1986 Mets. Not only does Perlman do a wonderful job detailing the on-field antics of the powerhouse team, but the details of their off the field trials and tribulations are just as exciting to relive. As a kid, I had no idea that Darryl and Gary Carter were such jerks, for different reasons. As an adult, I feel bad for the way Cashen and the rest of the front office used Kevin Mitchell as the scapegoat for off the field problems.How did I come to be a Mets fan? The first ball game I ever attended was a Yankees game in the Bronx when I was probably six or seven. I only remember that the Yankees were losing in the bottom of the ninth, with Reggie at the plate representing the go ahead run. I was hoping and praying for a homerun. Instead, Reggie struck out to end the game and break the heart of a budding Yankees baseball fan.A few years later, 1983, by dad somehow got some free tickets to a Mets game, box seats! We lived "upstate", so heading the city for a ballgame was always a special treat. I was only nine at the time. Wow, what a game. Not only did the Mets win, but a young rookie named Darryl Strawberry crushed a home run. I was hooked!I began following the team in earnest through the 83-84-85 seasons, as the Mets added names such as Hernandez, Carter, and Gooden to the roster. I remember the August 1986 double header against the Cardinals when the "Lets Go Mets Go" video was filmed between games. I can remember booing Doug Sisk at another game when Davey brought him during a rout over the then hapless Atlanta Braves. Nails was my personal favorite - I had to sneak a Sony walkman to school during the NLCS when he smacked his game winning homer against Houston. I still have Game 6 of the NLCS and Game 7 of the World Series on a VHS tape tucked away in a foot locker.I was only twelve years old during that wonderful 1986 season. I was still young and innocent enough not to fully understand the all the tragic flaws in Darryl, Doc, and the others. I will not defend the tragic mistakes that Doc, Darryl, and the rest made. At some level, I feel a bit sorry for both Doc and Darryl, who were still fairly young at this age. How many of us readers made similar, though perhaps not as severe, mistakes during our late teens and early twenties? However, most of us learned from those mistakes and put them behind us, whereas Doc and Darryl are still struggling with their demons almost twenty years later.The book is a fast read and a page turner from start to finish. I was able to finish the book on two three-hour plane rides. This is a must read for a Mets fan, and also for any baseball fan. I highly recommend
