As a child my favorite teachers in elementary school where the ones who read to us aloud.  I even had a 6th grade teacher who loved to read to us.  Ahh, I miss those days. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this to my children, yes even Dad and the older teen would wander into the room when I was reading this book.  A great Dragon-tale.  I do so enjoy going along for a new adventure without ever leaving the ground. Many praises for Cornelia's Fantastical Fun ride
