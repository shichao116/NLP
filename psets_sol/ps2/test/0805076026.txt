Some cautionary notes about this book are appropriate.  It was so well-reviewed when it came out back in the autumn that my expectations for it were raised higher than they perhaps should have been.  It's important to understand that Shadid focuses on a chunk of barely eighteen months in America's relationship with Iraq, starting in the fall of 2002 and largely concluding in the spring of 2004, although there is a very short and uncertain epilogue about the Constituent Assembly elections of January 2005.  And the first six months of that roughly eighteen-month period - the period leading up to the war itself - are covered pretty spottily.  My impression was that Shadid made only a couple of short trips to Baghdad in the latter part of 2002, and just didn't have much first-hand material to work from.Likewise, there were other points in the earlier parts of the book when Shadid would be describing his interactions with an Iraqi family, and I found myself thinking that no terribly worthwhile insights were emerging from this encounter.  I got the sense that Shadid had these old newspaper reports, and his publisher wanted them used to flesh things out, even if they didn't tell you that much in retrospect.But hang in there, because at about page 156, the book really catches fire.  In contrast to the somewhat stretched, spotty feeling of much of what precedes it, his almost 40-page chapter on Muqtada Sadr and his movement is a compelling, incisive, and revealing extended essay.  And then Shadid gets to the Occupation, and here he really finds his voice.  From his description of the senseless death of an average and perfectly harmless fifteen-year-old in an upper Tigris valley village on page 219 until the end of the book, the tragic power of the story Shadid has to tell wraps you in its grip and doesn't let go.Among the points he drives home are the following.  The failure to provide security in Baghdad upon the collapse of the old regime, and the feckless inability to restore essential services like electricity in the months that followed, almost immediately squandered whatever goodwill might otherwise have accrued to the Americans for getting rid of Saddam.  By as early as the summer months of 2003, the Americans had already worn out their welcome and the essential conditions necessary for the growth and resilience of the insurgency had been established.Shadid also effectively brings out the immense cultural chasm that separated Iraqis from Americans.  He recounts how, when an American patrol stops in at a school to see if the teachers need anything and to fraternize with the children, Iraqi men in the neighborhood suspiciously assume the soldiers are inside having sex with the female teachers.But Shadid's most remarkable accomplishment is to help the reader understand how and why young Iraqi men were willing to take up arms and join the insurgency, even though they knew that - especially in the early days - trying to carry the fight to the American military was quite literally a suicide mission.  Don Rumsfeld to the contrary, Shadid suggests that for most of the insurgents it had nothing to do with being Baathist bitter-enders.  Instead, a potent cocktail of national pride, religious feeling, and resentment of actual or inadvertent humiliations by the occupying forces fuels the insurgency.This is a terribly sad book.  Unlike George Packer or Seymour Hersh, Shadid does not focus at all on the senior councils of American government.  But by showing the impact on a disparate collection of Iraqis of what Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and Feith et al. planned, did, and failed to do, Shadid paints a devastating portrait of an arrogant but fatuous governing clique characterized by ignorance, parochialism, and a terrifying lack of understanding.
