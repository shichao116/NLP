We stumbled on this award-winning picture book by accident - but what a find!  Three clever mice, illustrated by author Ellen Stoll Walsh in colorful cut-paper collage, discover three jars of "mouse paint."  With childlike curiousity they dive right inside.  And like children who can't resist splashing in puddles (mine included), the mice "splash" and "mix" and "dance" until they make a colorful mess.  My daughters were already learning to identify colors.  With Mouse Paint I was able to introduce the mixing of colors RED, BLUE, and YELLOW to create GREEN, ORANGE, and PURPLE - a concept they would not have learned until later
