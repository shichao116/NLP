What Would Joey Do is a good book. I thought it was a good book to read once, but I wouldnt want to read it again. It was funny in some parts like when Joeys dad is talking about how a relationship is like a see-saw, you get tired of it and you get off so the other person goes flying to the ground and gets hert. There were other parts that was just boring and not very fun. Joey is going to a school where the school is at home and the teacher is obsessed with Jesus. She thinks Joey is the devil. Her daghter is really mean to Joey. Soon they embark on a funny adventure. Want more then check it out.
