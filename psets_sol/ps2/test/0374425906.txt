the tale of tangle and mossy, two child like creatures on the adventure of the ages. alone - together - parting - re-uniting, until which is which becomes forgotten and un-threatening, and best; so unimportant. Simply, this is The Best Fairey Tale I have ever read.It is a classic.If you know anyone with fantasy and imagination, regardless of age, this whould be a most welcome gift....Addendum: To - "A Reader"It is difficult to respond to a question after the questioner has left the room. Who is Dr. Peter Kreeft and what makes his opinion so important to you? It is sad that such a beautiful and wonderful story is so assaulted by a need to find the incarnation of GOD himself within it. Not that he/she is not; but please, isn't that the "Bible's" role? I think you last three comments point to your problem; that is, you really want someone "to tell you" what this book really means. Suggestion: Perhaps if you read the story to a child or a very old person over the course of three or four day, you might find it much more appealing.....best regards.
