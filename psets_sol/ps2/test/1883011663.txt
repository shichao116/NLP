This volume captures the essence of Madison's writings through the editor's skill in presenting 191 documents out of an archive of more than 25000 documents. Mr. Rakove presents a generally balanced array of letters,  speeches, and essays which are arranged chronologically.  Included are all  the Federalist Papers authored by Madison. The editor provided many  documents dealing with the Jay Treaty and Alien and Sedition Act, but fell  short in providing sufficient material during the period of Madison's  cabinet position as Secretary of State, covering the Louisiana Purchase and  the conflict with Britain and France prior to the War of 1812. That  deficiency may well be based on lack of documentation.   The book itself is  elegant, beautifully printed and is provided with a copy of the  Constitution, notes, an excellent chronology and a good index
