This is one of my all-time favorite books, and this is arguably Ms. Martin's best novel ever. I cried and cried reading this wonderful story, mostly because I lost my beloved grandmother to cancer. I identified with  every struggle the O'Hara family faced in the wake of the death of their  father, mostly I identified with Liza and Hope, who mourned in different  ways. I can't recommend this simple but powerful book enough. I don't care  how old you are. It's worth it
