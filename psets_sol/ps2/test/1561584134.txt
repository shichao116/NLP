Kaffe Fassett is a genius and his sweaters are beautiful .  I am happy to keep this book as a reference but I almost returned it to Amazon because I doubt I will ever make any of the sweaters showcased in this book.  They all use at least 20 different colors - one uses 40!!  I try to think of how much leftover yarn I am going to have to live with once a project is finished.  I'm not interested in spending a fortune on a sweater and then having to live with 20 partial skeins of yarn in different colors.I keep my books in pristine condition.  Hopefully it will go out of print and I can sell it on ebay at a profit in 6 or 7 years
