This is the very finest volume on the subject -- bar none.  Each and every car has a one- or two-page listing, complete with description, history, variations, and values by color. Photos are large and lavish. Hot Wheels playsets, accessories, and collateral merchandise are covered as well.  Plus, the book is published in a sturdy library binding.  It's well worth the price.
