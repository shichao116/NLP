I throughly enjoyed this book.  I love the way Debra White Smith weaves mystery and romance and a little comedy together to make a superb book!  Not knowing if Beth would choose Micheal or Scott kept me on the edge of my  seat!  I also enjoyed Beth's pet pig! I hope you read and enjoy it as much  as I did
