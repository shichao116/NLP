A collection of short stories told in reverse chronological order and held together by the presence of one painting. The earlier vignettes, or the later chapters of the book, are captivating as the Dutch lowlands and windmills take center stage in Vreeland's narratives. Characters have short-lived moments in the book, but that is okay once it becomes clear that the central character is the painting. The book is not long and it is easy to complete in a short time. An enjoyable result from reading the book, is that I found myself constantly looking at objects that have been around for a while, old coins, old buildings, and reflecting about the connections and stories these objects could tell about earlier times and people that have long departed.  I found the book worthy of recommending to my middle school age kid, so it is fine for young teenagers
