This is a very good book, it's my second favorite to learn from.This is my favorite:Blacksmithing Primer: A Course in Basic and Intermediate Blacksmithing (Paperback) by Randy McDaniel.If you are learning by yourself it's a much more complete set of lessons, including exactly how to position teh hammer to get each set of results. No other books teaches this.The DVD set is excellent too, but expensive.(Note, I know the guy who publishes the videos, but I didn't know he did until after I'd bought them, watched them, and recommended them to somone else...
