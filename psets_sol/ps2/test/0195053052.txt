My introduction to Aldo Leopold's words, reverberating within the covers of A Sand County Almanac, was at the ageof 5 on the earthy beat of my mother's voice.  The message, though above my 5-years ability to comprehend, tolleddeep within. To this day I can still recall the imagery flowing across my imaginary stage as mom read the recountingof Leopolds perceptive observations.  Even though at 5 I'd never seen a wild goose, deer or turkey in my homewoods; and had never heard anyone talk of them there; I knew with a ferver, that they could be in my woods: theyshould be in my home woods.  I knew I would look for them there as well.My first 'personal read' of A Sand County Almanac, was from that same book, checked out from the Library where mymom worked. Even though I'd heard the words several times before, each page was a new adventure. But much morethan the adventure I felt when reading the adventure stories I'd read from time-to-time on the 'kids' shelves'.  Thisadventure was happening in a very real world; my world.  That adventure went with me every day as I shuffled amongthe leaves, branches, rocks and soil in my home woods; as I stealthly searched under rocks, in the riffles and holes ofmy home waters.Though I read of Leopold's observations in Wisconsin, Arizona, Illinois, Missouri and other places, I saw each of themin my home woods; along the banks of my home creek; among the fields of my home wanderings.Leopold's words did not become my words ... no, they inspired my innermost heartbeat to rise to the surface wherein time I developed my own 'home words'.  Those are the same words that guide me to this very day.This book is much more than a collection of words from a wise man. A Sand County Almanac is an inspired text.Inspired by a time far removed from where our society stands today.  Written by a man with a clear-eyed vision ofthe future; from wisdom, born of knowledge and understanding on how to attain a better future; above the usualhuman frailty.  All said, in simple, clear, humble tones that beckon you to listen; to learn; to understand; to wiselyapply: to pass on.  Leopold was a scientiest with a wonderous command for the ability to put his thoughts in the morepeaceable tones ... even when those words are meant as stern, hard-hitting corrections.In essence, A Sand County Almanac is one of those rare pieces of literature that promotes the finest form ofsustainability: natural wisdom.A Sand County Almanac is a must read for all people; of all ages; for all times.  It is timeless and so is our human need tohear it's timeless message.  Read it often. Read it to others.
