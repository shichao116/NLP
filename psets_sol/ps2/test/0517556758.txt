This book was written in the EARLY 80's - and for a 90's bride, it is totally outdated.  Don't bother spending money on this one until she writes an updated version, which hopefully should be expected soon.   With  Martha's popularity, you would think she wouldn't rely on this book to lead  her into the 90's.  Buy Colin Cowie or Beverly Clark instead
