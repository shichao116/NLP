Received this  book as  a Christmas gift  from my daughter. I did  not get to read it right away, However   for a  book to read on a long flight  my wife read  it first.When  she landed  she was so enthused about the book she said  "I am not a WWII  buff  or a  fanatic about baseball in general but YOU HAVE TO READ THIS WHEN I RETURN"   Fortunately I had jury duty  on her return  with the book and  in two days  I was  clutching this book like the The Holy GrailI wanted it to begin again. Having  had a baseball dad  with a  very heroic WWII past, the story hit me on so many levels  I was teary eyed  by page 24 .What was so ironic is I kept relating to the relationship that I also had  with my dad , a man of  humble mystery  and his  own reluctance to think  or talk anymore  about  "what if..?  He  was stopped also in his passion  to play major league baseball but lacked the higher skills needed and  then WWII  arrived  and he was off to Anzio , Normandy  and Africa where  he too witnessed  the exibition baseball games in person. I had to immediatly correspond  with  the author which Gary  so graciuosly  did reply .Then the irony started to occur  we are  nearly neighbors 15 minutes  apart   and have  crossed paths over 20 years of business ventures and travels several times. I knew his  father but  for business not baseball or war stories.Gary is a  very gifted  writer to say the least and the story, the charactors, the times ,the events  are an amazing interaction of historical events. Definately left me wanting more.
