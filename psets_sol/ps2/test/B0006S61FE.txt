The reason I had to order a second copy of this book is that I leant out my last one, and I didn't get it back.  I want to be able to lend this book to others, so they might understand the fictional story of survival of Jess Goldberg, and also read about the history of a variety of things including gender and sexual orientation challenges.  I loved this book, and I felt like I was living inside Jess as I read her story.  The way she reacted to the situations she faced really made sense to me
