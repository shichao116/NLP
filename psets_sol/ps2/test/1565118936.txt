Lian Hearn lost me on this one.  This is the third and final book of the original Tales of the Otori trilogy (there's a fourth book set decades after this one ends that reportedly resolves the one dangling issue from the trilogy) and it is easily the worst.  Across the Nightingale Floor was very good with swift pacing, a mentally tough heroine and solid action; Grass for his Pillow was a decent middle volume that moved the story forward, set up the final book and did not lose too much momentum.Brilliance of the Moon is a relative flop.  The two main characters, Takeo and Kaede, make laughably stupid decisions.  Kaede loses too much of her inner strength -- she becomes simply the damsel in distress.  And the anti-climactic, deus ex machina resolution to Takeo's quest is entirely too unsatisfying.If you can read Book 1 and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel despite its status as the first in a trilogy/tetralogy, do so.  But you're forewarned before you get too deep into the story, the ending in this volume is pure disappointment
