I just got this book delivered to me at work along with Volume Two: Cables, and they are both awesome!  What I really like is that there's no "learn to knit" section taking up precious pages...just a short forward and then on to the stitch patterns, every single one of which is just gorgeous!  Can't say enough great things about this book
