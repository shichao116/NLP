"Seeing", by Jose Saramago is in the genre of great books like Orwell's "1984" that deal with the efforts of States of all political persuasions to control and manipulate the lives of their citizens.Such States don't have to be totalitarian regimes.  Liberal democracies also go to great lengths to "condition" their citizens in the face of perceived threats.  They also engage in questionable human rights and legal practices in dealing with those threats.  The current war on terrorism fits this mould exactly, but it is nothing new to those of us who lived through the Cold War of the 1950s and 1960s.Books like "Seeing" serve as a salutary reminder that governments are not always on our side, and it behoves us to be very vigilant to avoid erosion of our rights in the struggle against terrorism, communism or whatever "-ism" is the current fixation.There is also an uplifting theme in this book, and that is the bravery of insiders who dare to tell the truth to the public, regardless of the cost to themselves.  That gives us hope that, in the end, justice will emerge from the murky morass of expediency.In "Seeing" 80% of the voters in the capital city of some imaginary country turn in blank votes at the national elections.  This shocks the government, so they re-run the election.  But the proportion of blank votes goes up to 83%.  The politicians in charge now fear that some kind of vast anti-government conspiracy is afoot.In order to punish the citizens of the capital and unmask the conspirators, all government services move out of the city and it is placed under a state of siege.  The interior minister also arranges for a bomb to go off in a train station and to be blamed on the still unknown conspirators.None of this works, so the political leadership looks for a scapegoat to take the blame.Police spies are sent into the besieged city to find evidence that the blank voting was a big conspiracy against the government, but they don't hear anyone talking about blank votes.   When they report this to their boss he says "That's a good sign. The proof that there is a conspiracy lies precisely in the fact that no one talks about it."Ideologues and fundamentalists of the left and right should read this book and re-think the basis of their own zealotry.  Of course they never will, because such folk never seek to question their unshakeable beliefs.  If they read books at all, they prefer books that confirm their fears and hatreds.Readers who are concerned about truth and morality in politics and the cynical erosion of our liberties by those in power should read this book.  Perhaps it will give us courage to speak out about practices that in our hearts we know to be wrong and destructive of our liberties.The book is written with little conventional punctuation.  Dialogue does not have quotation marks and frequently one speaker's words run into another's with only a comma to separate them.  This style serves to depersonalise the narrative and is quite effective, but it does make reading a little difficult.
