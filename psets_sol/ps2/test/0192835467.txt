I have read WoN in three different editions and undoubtedly the best was the definitive version in the Glasgow edition of his Collected Works. This is cheaply and conveniently reporinted in the Liberty Fund edition which I recommend to anyone who is actually *studying* the text. It notes variations between different editions and has extremely useful notes which are helpful in understanding Smith's relations to his predecessors.It's an interesting book, over-quoted and under-read. Read it - all of it - and you will find a rather different argument and conclusions from that bestowed upon this classic by partisans of untrammeled free markets who trumpet some sound-bites from the book but reject Smith's underlying argument
