You may not have  heard very much about it in school, and you definitely will not not hear about it in the national media, but the north was also very much invovled in slavery up to the civil war! When the question is asked "What was the main reason for this terrible period in our history?" the typical answer is SLAVERY! Taking this train of thought to its end, the true answer is "PROFIT" (power/money). I am very much a believer in capitolism, but not at the expense of human beings! I believe this book demonstrates many powerful people in the north sought profit over people, as did the southerners who owned slaves. Let us not forget the fact that many fellow Africans made profits from selling other blacks into slavery. So now you see that there are guilty parties on all 3 points of the triangular trade! If you are very much interested in American History, I highly recommend this book to you for a fair and balanced look at American slavery. If you maybe somewhat interested in this subject, I believe you'll find some very interesting informatiom in it also
