Speer began his twenties one of the most promising architects of his generation, and ended his days haunted by a life that included a position as Hitler's confidant and protégé, a man who had lived the 1940's, truly inside the Third Reich. Albert Speer provides a singular embodiment of the enigma that is the German of his age. Speer was highly intelligent, utterly creative, imaginative, ambitious and above all civilized in a way only a genteel European of the early twentieth-century could have claimed to be. And yet this man of potential cast his loyalty to that most evil of modern states and aided it to the fullest of his ability. Speer is indeed a human puzzle. How did his life and the lives of eighty million of his fellow Germans go so astray?This book is certainly a must-read for anyone wishing a well-rounded education in the Second World War and the internal operation of the Nazi empire, because Speer was privy to top-secret meetings within the Nazi junta and relates with candor details of the plans and goals of his masters in Berlin. Albert Speer courageously, the facts show, confronted Hitler in his final days and refused to carry out the by-then demented dictator's plot to flood the subways of Berlin, an act which would have caused the deaths of thousands of civilians who had sought shelter there.Speer is also, sadly, for all his bravery and intellect, a liar, and for that reason it's wisest to tread lightly over some portions of this written history. We know of Speer's dishonesty more concretely today than ever before, owing to facts that have come to light in the two decades since his death---facts too complicated to go into for the purposes of this review. We know that Speer's claims of plotting an attempt on Hitler's life by infusing poison gas into the exhaust system of his bunker complex, was in all likelihood an unmitigated fabrication. Given this, how much else may we trust in Speer's account? I suspect we may go so far as to trust Albert Speer in his recollections that do not contain himself in a pivotal role. By that I mean, the aged Speer, near life's end, veteran of a twenty-year prison sentence in Spandau, probably found it irresistible to exonerate his own actions and make himself an heroic agent in opposition to Hitler. For that reason, this document of the goings-on inside Nazi Germany, only rates four stars instead of the five it might have gotten.
