All study and exam guides for these tests strongly recommend using college level texts to study and the test-prep as a guide so why would anyone expect to pass without opening a text book??  I took five of the exams, used college texts to assist me in areas of the subject where I was weak (based on guide book exams).  I passed all the exams but I already had taken many business courses so the lower level "intro" courses were easy-much of the material I had already covered. And, I studied.  I think too many people expect exact questions from current exams to be on the practice exams.  The type of questions and key points are there.  This is well worth price as a Study Guide but remember it's a guide - not all inclusive
