I almost feel like a sadist enjoying a series of books about the perils and unfortunate lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Beaudelaire...almost.  The Miserable Mill (Volume 4 in the 13 book cycle) is an enjoyable time.  With every page the dire situation of our three protagonists gets worse, and yet the humor and inside jokes come at a rapid fire pace.The plot has our three orphans stuck working at a lumbermill for their new caretaker "Sir".  Yes, three children are working long grueling hours around saws and other deadly devices and in return Sir will do his best to keep the sinister Count Olaf away from them.  Of course, if you've read the series you'll know that this is easier said than done...and wood won't be the only thing ending up in those lumbermill saws.I would not recommend that a new reader start with this novel (no the series needs to be read in order) but certainly this is a great addition to the series and should keep you turning the pages with a smile on your face
