I cannot understand how anyone can say anything bad about this book. It is absolutely fantastic to learn about working with the UNIX operating system. Detail, step-by-step explanations and examples of the main UNIX commands. If you need to work with UNIX, buy this book NOW! There is no better guide to help you get started in the confusing world of UNIX. I wish someone would write Oracle database books that are this easy to use and reference. Thanks to the authors
