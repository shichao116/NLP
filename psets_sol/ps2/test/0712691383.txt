A more appropriate subtitle for this book is "A NEWLY CONTRIVED History of the Western World"As another reviewer here states Osborne comes down hard on Western Civilization. This includes America, as well as many other regimes and occurrences that truly shaped Western Civilization. Osborne adoringly praises the Greeks, like Plato, who, oddly enough he acknowledges devised and advocated an artless society of dictatorship run by elitist philosophers in his book "The Republic", and Osborne ignores how the Greek concept of an earth-centered universe crippled Western thought for well over a millennium. Yet, these things don't bother Osborne who instead willfully praises the Greeks and besmirches the great entities, like Rome or America that had enormous influence on the world stage.He lambastes Rome for being aggressive and for building an empire based upon their beliefs of what they considered "civilization", and with an ignorant swipe of his hand, Osborne wipes away centuries of colossal influence, which have truly shaped our modern world. You cannot condemn an entire civilization for making some mistakes. Britain, America, Australia have all engaged in conquest, as has all other major regimes, yet he innocently expects no violence to occur to effect those huge changes, as if the American Indians, or Aborigines peoples would have said, "Hi pale-faced strangers, here, take all of our land. We'll just leave peacefully. No problem." This is the idyllic type of nonviolent world that Osborne believes exists in reality. Any rational mind knows otherwise.These acts were not humane in one respect, but were crucial in another, since any race that feels that they must fight to ensure their ideologies and ultimate survival inevitably must do so, or risk annihilation themselves. Nation building is always an ugly business, and history shows that there are always winners and always losers. It's an ugly fact that must be understood and put into context. Mr. Osborne, as well as millions of us Americans would not exist today if our forefathers lost that struggle for survival, and that is the reality often overlooked by authors who sit in their comfortable office or studio not realizing that the blood of their ancestors secured their comfortable lifestyle and their very existence.Therefore, nation building requires a strong ideology, determination, unity and, yes, blood. Its unfortunate, but it's a reality of life that directly affects not some, but all histories of mankind. The important issue is did these regimes make positive influences, or did they only thrust their conquered territories into poverty, chaos or unremitting suppression? It's a given that some always suffer, but the majority of people in these new regimes did prosper, and did create and generate much positive influence that overshadows these unfortunate side effects, or casualties. Nothing is perfect, and every issue has two sides, which need to be weighed carefully, but knowledge of that other side is mandatory. Yet, Osborne only focuses on these negative side effects.Other absurdities abound, as he lambastes the Italian Renaissance, clearly demonstrating how occurrences outside the realm of his understanding can be crucial to world history. Certain areas of endeavor, which may seem trivial to some, do affect influence and change in profound ways, and Osborne unfortunately fails to see this. Although he does purport some good and true historical facts, and has a very nice writing style, this book cannot be taken seriously in total. It is not well rounded, nor is it truly accurate. I was expecting a concise, but accurate, portrayal of Western history, but the many erroneous conclusions asserted by the author make this a very distorted and unjust view of the greatest civilizations to ever grace this planet.Hence, my suggestion is to seek other authors, otherwise those who are uniformed about history will fall victim to Osborne's alien and anemic views
