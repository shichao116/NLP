IMHO this is the best book that Rita Mae Brown has written. As other reviewers have noted there are hilarious scenes in the book. If the events occurring during the fourth of July parade don't have you falling off your chair, then you're not breathing. Although the book is quite funny, that's not what I enjoy most about it. What makes 6 of 1 so special to me is the way it describes relationships between people. These relationships strike home and appear real rather than fictional. When I looked at 6 of 1 on amazon many of the 'listmania' lists categorized this as literature for lesbians. I disagree, this is literature for everyone
