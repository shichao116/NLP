Simply.. a very good book.Gives a very, very broad perspective of this perid. Many testimonies are included, from different kind of people (ranging form a High ranking officier to the common soldier.. civilian) and from different countries.Brief stories, half a page lenght (at most) that gives you a broad sense and understanding on what happened at that time. Also a very balanced one.If you are a military modeler, you can get hundred of ideas for your dioramas trough situation description.Conclusion: highly recommendabl
