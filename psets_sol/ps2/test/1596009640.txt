Since Tears of the Moon was somewhat of a disappointment, it was with hesitation that I picked up Heart of the Sea. Boy, I'm glad I did. Although Jewels of the Sun will always reign as my favorite of the trilogy, this comes in an easy second.The story begins with Trevor Magee, the grand-nephew of Maude's long lost love, (the cousin of Jude's grandma) coming back to Ardmore to build a theatre. He's charming, he's good looking, he's hardworking, intelligent, and rich. All the things that Darcy, the youngest Gallagher, has been looking for all her life in a man. She's beautiful, ambitious, smart, courageous, and she knows it. From the first time they lay eyes on each other, it's obvious that they're gonna tumble in bed, and after some flirting and friendly challenges, they do.Their chemistry lacks the romantic poignancy that Jude and Aidan shared and still do, but also a believability and raw excitement there that Shawn and Breena lacked. Darcy and Trevor aren't romantic, tender people. For all their flaws, they're decent, but neither are ones to beat around the bush. Initally, all they want is sex and companionship, and don't make any bones about it. They're so well matched, I found myself laughing and said to myself: "They so deserve each other!"Some have complained that Darcy is an unsymathetic character. I don't think she is. She's vain, somewhat selfish and materialistic, but I can respect her for recognizing that in herself, and her bad qualities are balanced by her many good ones. Beside the qualities I mentioned above she also loyal, hardworking, and loving, and is a great sister, and I believe will be a great wife and mother.For all those Jude/Adian fans out there, (I be one of them) you will enjoy the birth of their child (not going to give the sex away) and the description of the birth with the family all around.Well, what are you waiting for? Go and get yourself a copy. I read mine in one day
