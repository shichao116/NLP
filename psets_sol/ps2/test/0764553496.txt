This book gives a great deal of very good advice for housetraining your dog in several different ways. I have employed many of the techniques described in this book. My only wish is that more space had been devoted to indoor housetraining for smaller dogs and toy breeds. But, since indoor training is a relatively new concept and this book appears to have been published about five years ago, I can understand why more space was not devoted to the subject. And, admittedly, it is likely a rather small percentage of us for whom indoor training would apply. Overall, worth the read
