The latest Taschen Icon graphics book finally catches up with the American festive season and presents a delightful collection of historical printed matter. I liked the comprehensive selection of items, cards, wrapping paper, parcel tags, consumer ads, magazine covers, photos of house decorations, sheet music covers and all in colour. Historically they come from Victorian times to about the mid-sixties.Kris Kringle obviously gets a good showing and I was surprised to see that he was depicted as a plump guy many years before illustrator Haddon Sundblom fixed his size for ever in 1932 for the first of his annual Coca-Cola paintings. Incidentally, as the drinks company has used Christmas as a strong selling point hundreds of items they have created can be seen 'Coca-Cola Collectible Santas' (ISBN 1887432930)***FOR A LOOK INSIDE click 'customer images' under the cover.
