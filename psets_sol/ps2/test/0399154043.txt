This is the most disappointing piece of childish trash I have encountered in many a day.  I have absolutely wasted my money and feel cheated.  This piece of junk is without literary value of any kind.  If you enjoy reading about a cop who is going to a shrink to get free, of among many things, a drinking problem, but who continually walks around evenings with a stiff drink in his hand moaning about how much he loves his ex wife who is having affairs with others, then this is your piece of writing.  Notice i didn't say literature.  An extremely poorly written piece of garbage!!
