In recent days the evangelistic public invitation has come under heavy fire on many fronts.  In some cases the criticism is well deserved because of public invitations that attempt to manipulate spiritual seekers.  As such, many evangelists have retreated from calling people to a public commitment to Christ.  "The Effective Invitation" by Dr. R. Alan Streett provides a powerful apologetic and a practical guide for a return to the public invitation.  In this 252-page volume, the gospel message is clearly outlined, and an outstanding explanation of repentance and saving faith is provided.The author presents the Biblical and historic precedents for the public invitation, followed by a fascinating chapter chronicling Billy Graham's use of the invitation. Streett answers the critics and presents the pertinent reasons for extending an evangelistic call. Finally, he examines the "how to's" of preparing and delivering an authentic and effective public invitation. This includes an assessment of the various models used to invite people to make a decision. The book concludes with sections on the use of music (somewhat dated) during the invitation and insights into the particular sensitivities required when inviting children to Christ."The Effective Invitation" is concise, persuasive, and practical. I'm aware of no better book on the subject. I highly recommend it to any pastor or evangelist who desires to see people come to Christ through the public invitation
