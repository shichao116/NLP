Lucas Davenport is feeling the ice-cold winter in this book in the prey-series. A horrible killer is on the loose, and contrary to many Davnport novels, the reader does not initially know who the killer is. But we are inside his mind all the time, we are inside his house, we listen to his talk, his thoughts and his 'family's' thoughts. And those are chilling thoughts. We know that the killer wants to kill Weather, the small-town doctor, who will later become Davenports girlfriend. The town's sheriff is trying to help as good as he can, but has issues on his own, specially after the town priest become suspect number one. All the evidence points this way, and it is now up to Daenport to sort through what is right and what is wrong
