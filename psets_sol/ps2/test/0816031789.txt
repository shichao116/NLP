Edward de Bono challenges us in the way we think. &quot;Intelligence is a pontential, but thinking is an operational skill&quot;, he says. This is a more fundamental book, and an excellent primer on de Bono's &quot;thinking&quot; rather than a book on how to do it. He tackles points like &quot;why many intelligent people are trapped&quot; or &quot;why critical thinking is a valuable part of thinking but totally inadequate on its own&quot;. De Bono covers many topics in this book (incl. his famous Lateral Thinking) and some rather abstract excercises I didn't like. Rather difficult topics like emotion, other people, or thinking &amp; doing are included which prove de Bono as the best in the world on thinking. Bravo
