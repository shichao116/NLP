This is an excellent book EXPLAINING matters of colored pencil.  It's a wonderful "how to" book and you won't find a great CP artist that Kullberg.  However, I'm one of those people she elludes to in this book about her first book and the misunderstandings developed from it.  Many people thought that non-human objects in CP would be created just as she outlined in her first book.  They aren't!  Obviously, the misunderstanding was quite a problem or it would have taken up so much real estate in this second book.Nevertheless, she is giving and generous in her approach to sharing her passion in this work.  Most people familiar with Ann Kullberg will own both books anyway so, it's just a matter of some unfortunate re-arranging and adjustment.  That said, this book is proof that even the most humble of artistic instruments become tools of art on the walls in Heaven from a master's hand.  Ann is that Master with Colored Pencil.  One item not covered in the book is that the thoughts and concepts here in CP do somewhat transfer to the world of Acrylics.  She wouldn't be the first CP artist to discover this but, I believe if she did, she would soon become the best. Of all the Italian Masters, she reminds me most of Leonardo Divinci with her vent on translucent layering.  Not a bad idea, adapting the techniques of someone like that.  You should own this book.  I even bought the products she recommends and I've been WOWed!  Now, that rarely happens.  Good book, good teacher... can't go wrong.
