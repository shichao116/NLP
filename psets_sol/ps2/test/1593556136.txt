Initially, I would have expected that Rosalind would have been featured in the 3 book, but I understand why she wasn't.  I found this to be thrilling... I couldn't put it down.  I love the characters, and was frantic for the third book to come out.  Compelling and worth the read! I'll definitely re-visit this story
