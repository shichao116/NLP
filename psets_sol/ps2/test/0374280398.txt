In Uncommon Carriers, McPhee delves into the world of shipments.  At first that may not sound like the most interesting topic, but that is only because you have no idea what goes on to get things where they need to be.  It was informative, interesting, and a very entertaining read.  I especially enjoyed the chapter titled "Five Days on the Concord and the Merrimack Rivers" because I have family in Massachusetts, and could appreciate the landmarks he refers to in the book.  I will be passing the book along to my family and friends
