In readable, friendly style, Konrad Lorenz uses illustrations from his everyday life among animals of all kinds to illustrate a variety of fascinating points.  The balance between anecdotes and theory is well  handled and the book stands out both as education and as entertainment.  I  find the sections dealing with keeping animals in captivity especially  worthwhile - Lorenz explains clearly and concisely why most people feel  sorry for captive animals for all the wrong reasons, this section should be  required reading for most people who think that they are promoting 'animal  rights'.  Highly recommended
