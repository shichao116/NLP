As a republican thru and thru I came to this book with a HUGE bias against Trumann, namely that I remembered him being one of Jimmy Carter's hero's!  However I was taking a long drive so I took the book on tape and WOW!  David McCullough certainly demonstraits why he wown the Pulizer Prize by taking a man I was inclined to dislike, who social politics I tottally disagreed with and got me not only interested in the man but liking him.Harry as an officer in WWI was delightfully insightful.His rise in machine politics was fascinating proving even to this reader that sometimes good men do rise in machine systems.Harry's personal commitment to people who had stood by him even when politically costly showed much about his character.There seems little question that the Truman Commission contributed mightily to the war effort not so much in what it exposed but in the fear it inspired and hence the encouragement it gave to government contractors to do a good and honest job.The late presidential years were eclipsed by world events, so his inovations and refurbashment of the White House got little play but his contribution in perserving the structure cannot be understated.Truman was a man, a leader, a president besought with problems and difficulties as well as bad luck and some very poor choices.  His popularity was very low by the time he left office, but history, at least David McCullough's has been kind to him.A very satisfying read on nearly every leve
