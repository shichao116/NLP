As a woman who is used to being the tallest female in the room, this book was a delight for me.  It's clear to her father and I that our 3 year old daughter will be following in the footsteps(size 10 1/2) of her mother.  We read this book now and then because it's never too soon to promote a positive self-image.  I want my daughter to embrace her size and be proud of who she is
