The concept of Manifest Destiny took root during the Mexican American War, and assumed grander proportions following the Civil War.  Gen. Crook had been a calvery officer whose services proved to be of considerable value,  as much for his ability as for his compassion for the Indians.  His job was  to protect the settlers and subdue the Indians by locating them on  reservations.  The author was with Crook during his first and second  Southwest campaigns as well as that of the Northern Plains.  His love for  his commander and appreciation of the Indians made him the perfect writer  for the topic.  Gen. Crook seems the ideal officer for the job, but was  defeated, not by the Indians but Agents assigned, after the army had done  its work, to reservations by Washington.  The book is a wonderful  description of the duty performed by Gen. Crook who, had his system been  utilized, would have led to a better life for all. In the end, Bourke  feels, Crook died of a broken heart. Important history, and a story too  beautifully told to miss
