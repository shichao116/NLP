This first book in the Penn-Dutch mystery series by Tamar Myers is nothing short of wonderful.  From start to finish this page turner is full of kooky characters that we quickly cherish (well, most of them), a hilarious narrative, and a darned good mystery to boot.  Not to mention the recipes!  A pure pleasure to read.  Thank you, Ms. Myers
