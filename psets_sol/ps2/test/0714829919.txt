I bought this book because I wanted an anthology of &quot;the best,&quot; classic articles on a variety of fields and from a variety of critical viewpoints, hoping to use it for my introductory art history course.  But  not only could one quarrel with the choices here, but the articles are  abridged almost to the point of incomprehensibility and the footnotes are  left out.  This makes the collection unrepresentative of what it purports  to be about, and useless in the classroom
