I'll warn you before buying this book, you might find it to be a real wakeup call.  Brother and Sister get involved in a TON of activities and are literally being drug by their parents someplace every day. Whether it's horseback riding, swimming, soccer or dance, Mama is toting them from here to there while trying to fit her own schedule into the mess.  Papa helps sometimes, but he's busy with his work too.  When the car finally breaks down and Sister and Brother are late for some event, Mama just goes upstairs and cries.  This upsets the cubs and Brother runs off into the woods to get his Papa.  Mama is okay when he arrives and they have a family meeting right then and there to decide what part of their schedules is going to be eliminated.  It really helps you put into place how busy your life can become when you're not looking.  Love this book in our house and we HIGHLY recommend it
