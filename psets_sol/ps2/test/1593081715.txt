The audio CD version of Dubois' &quot;Souls of Black Folks&quot; is horrible. The reader makes mistake after mistake. He mispronounces words, makes breaks where none were to be taken, and his reading in general is poor. He has made a vibrant and enjoyable read a boring and atrocious listening experience. I guess I'll have to find something else to listen to on those long drives. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT Purchase this rendering of &quot;Souls&quot;
