Josef Vadassy teaches languages in Paris. He takes a vacation on the French Riviera, and brings his Zeiss Contax camera to take photographs. When his roll is finished he brings it in for development. There is a problem when he comes to pick it up: it has pictures of a restricted naval base at Toulon. The police question him, and discover that another camera had been switched for his. Vadassy is stateless; he was born in a part of Hungary that was turned over to Jugoslavia. While a student at the University of Buda-Pesth his elder brother and father were shot by the Jugoslav police for their involvement in politics. The French police demand his cooperation, or he will be deported back to Jugoslavia. Vadassy must inquire among his fellow guests to find the person who also has a Zeiss Contax.The rest of the book tells of his experiences with the other 12 guests at the small hotel. Vadassy must report his findings to the police each day about the cameras and other events. Vadassy talks to these guests and learns more about them, at least what they tell him. Chapter 13 has the story of Herr Heinberger, more realistic that the story of "Victor Laszlo" of "Casablanca". The plan of the police works, and the real spy is traced to his employer. Vadassy will become a French citizen, and discovers some truths about the other guests. They were not what they seemed.This was Eric Ambler's first successful novel. Like his other novels, it shows the struggle of one person against the power of a state, and his survival. The 'Footnote' for the 1951 edition says the Sumerian rulers of Mesopotamia were using undercover operators thousands of years before Moses sent spies into Canaan. Yet spy stories were only published in the early twentieth century. Detective stories were first published in the mid-nineteenth century. I suspect that society was mostly rural or in small town, and did not have the big cities that need detectives, or the imperialism that needed spies.
