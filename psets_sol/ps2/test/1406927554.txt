I have had this book for about a year now and I would say it is still the most helpful I have found for reading Humes' Treatise.  Everything is explained well and completely, but it is the depth that impresses me, not only are the concepts explained with clarity, but in places where a point relates to an earlier concept it is noted down to the paragraph of where it appeared.  Also when another philosophers view is similar or conflicts with Humes own view it is noted.  The annotations in the back of the book alone by their helpfulness would give this book 5 stars, but the introduction is about as close as I have seen to a complete summary of Humes book without having to buy another book entirely.  Overall the author has a good understanding of the text and can relate it to the student
