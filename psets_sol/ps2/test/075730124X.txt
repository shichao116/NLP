I have had this book since it was published, about 1990. On my initial reading I thought it heavily favored the daughter's point of view. Since rereading it recently I found it ofers a fairness I hadn't seen before, and some profound insights into the value the book offers. Examples: &quot;The best advice you can give yourself is yours.&quot; &quot;May you have the joy of following your own advice.&quot; And particularly the thought that if after reading the book we can see the way we can change, we are in a powerful position. On the contrary, if we think in terms of underling sections just to point out to the other how wrong she is, then we've lost that power. I appreciated the fact the book did not tell us to run out for a therapy session. We have the power and the potential within ourselves to change and to compromise for the sake of a wonderful daughter/mother relationship
