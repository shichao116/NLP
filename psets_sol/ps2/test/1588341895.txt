One has a sneaking suspicion reading this volume that Hanson started with his conclusion first (that Greeks invented the so-called "Western" way of war which, according to Hanson, requires emphasis on "decisive" battles) and worked his way back. The "uniqueness" of the Western way of war remains unproven (proving it would require an analysis of methods of waging war by other civilizations), and moreover it is far from clear that Hanson's "Western way of war" has been actually waged by Western states.
