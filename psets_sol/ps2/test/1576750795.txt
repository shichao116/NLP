Janelle Barlow and her co-authors always write well: the message is generally clear and the language is simple. As with her earlier book, The Complaint is a Gift, I got a great deal out of this book, Emotional Value.  Very early on I was convinced that, indeed, American businesses do not  adequately embrace the Emotional Value concept, at least not sufficiently  to use it as a critical operational underpinning. I was also convinced that  the narrower notion of Emotional Value very effectively requires the reader  to look more closely at the broader notion of the experience economy.  (Which I did, to my great satisfaction.) Like The Complaint is a Gift,  Emotional Value is a starting place that simply makes sense. To have these  ideas so clearly spelled out is a boon for all who are ready to buy into  it. But it is of great interest to me that neither of these books - or  their central ideas - are being adopted or even considered on any large  scale by the one industry that needs them the most: the American Health  Care Delivery System. These books, on their own, are simply not compelling  to those who would resist. Part of the problem has to do with  oversimplification, for example, seeing &quot;unconscious reactions&quot;  only as having a negative impact: on page 34, the authors want to  &quot;reduce the impact of unconscious reactions ... let us live  consciously.&quot; In reality, the appeal is to establish an alternative  set of unconscious (as well as conscious) reactions that add to rather than  detract from the sales or service situation. In reality, we want to shape,  not abrogate our unconscious motivations. Further, the relationship of  emotional value as a strategy to the experience economy as a concept is not  always clear. Part of the message seems to be that since the emotional  value approach focuses on the experiences of the customer, that emotional  value, inter alia, is a manifestation of the experience economy concept.  Emotional value is rather simply a nicely crafted and smart approach to the  service economy. And the book does this task well: It convinced me that  there is something beyond simply commodities, products and services that  current and future business enterprises will be able to offer consumers. I  am ready to make the experience economy part of the health care industry.  Thank you Janelle and Diana
