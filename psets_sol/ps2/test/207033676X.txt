Most fiction writers don't have to live through a tragedy at the same time that they are writing a novel about it. In this particular case the author of Suite Francaise doesn't survive long enough to finish the short trilogy on WWII that she was writing.The first short novel, "Storm in June" describes the panicky, unprepared migration of Parisians from the city to the countryside, and the second novel "Dolce" tells us about life in a small town under German occupation. In the first book we follow various individuals and families as they flee the invasion. In this character study we find that there are few French heroes. Nemirovsky is particularly hard on the well to do; they are selfish and full of their own self importance. It is the poorer village dwellers that go out of their way to help feed and shelter the evacuees. A few of the Parisians die, and in a way that is abrupt and stunning. It is interesting that the author aims most of her scorn at the wealthy in so far as she came from an extremely wealthy family and had a degree of fame herself as a French author.In Dolce we see townsfolk adapting to German occupation. The French men smolder with hate for the intruders while many of the younger women seem to fall for the charms of the young, handsome German soldiers. The protagonist of this novel is Lucille Angellier, who lives with her mother-in-law while her husband languishes in a German POW camp. Her mother-in-law detests Lucille partly because she thinks Lucille is too friendly with a German officer who is living with them. This feeling of hate is reciprocated by Lucille. A bonding does begin when Lucille engages in a heroic, life threatening act of defiance.These two novels provide an amazing picture of life during a horrible part of history. The book impresses you with its realism, nothing melodramatic, just people figuring out how to survive. The portion of the book describing Lucille and her mother-in-law may be a bit autobiographical as Nemirovsky and her mother also had a cold relationship.It is interesting to note that although the author was Jewish, and would die in Auschwitz in 1942, she makes no mention at all of the plight of Jews in Germany or France.I have read a lot of books on WWII, but this is an unusually fascinating product of that period. Included in the book are Nemirovsky's notes for writing the book and some letters from her husband written to various people trying to secure their help in getting his wife released from German custody. Finally there is a nine page biography of the author. It's short but it's spellbinding reading.A very notable book. Don't miss reading it
