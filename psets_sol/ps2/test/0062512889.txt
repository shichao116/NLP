This delightful book is written from a spiritual and maternal perspective.  It explores parenting in the frame of reference of a single day beginning with the middle-of-the-night feeding of an infant. The story of &quot;one day&quot; has a &quot;parallel theme&quot; of raising children from infancy through adulthood. The author addresses the beauty and joy of daily life as well as illness, loss, and grieving in the context of parenting.  I've read the book a number of times and enjoyed it immensely. It would also work well for a discussion group.  Her writing is very insightful and provacative.  Enjoy
