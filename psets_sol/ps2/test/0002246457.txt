O.k. I will admitt I am a book worm I mean I read the whole series in 2 weeks but I loved it so much.  This book was awsome it had so many twist and turns and it did have a great story even if some don't agree.  Katherine makes you know the person her characterization is so good.  Every person I can feel what they are feeling even if it takes a while to get to know some of them.  In this book I found that She kept on doing it.  I was not shure of the dragon in the beginning but it ended that I do like her but then that surprise came that was hinted in the begginning.  You will have to read and see how many surprises show up. I say read this book NOW!
