This novel, Hanif Kureishi's first, is a fascinating portrait of 1970s London. It focuses on a young Indian boy growing up with a father who styles himself as the eponymous Buddha of Suburbia. The father's character is great-- he has never been spiritual, but the yuppies of his suburb think that because he is Eastern, he must be Wise in All Things. The father begins to believe in his own greatness and leaves his wife and family in order to move in the circles of higher society. The entire cast of characters is a great bunch, often hilarious and very authentic.The aspect of this story which I found most engaging was how well it told the tale of adolesence. Kureishi perfectly captures that process by which we move from being children to thinking we know everything to finally realizing we know nothing.Kuresihi has since written several more novels, and I'm looking forward to hunting them down
