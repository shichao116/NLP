I first read this text when I was taking a course in surveying Ancient Middle Eastern languages and texts.  I have however found it to be more interesting for study of ancient religion than linguistics.  Many of the myths contain the imagery that Lovecraft should have used to make his terrors more terrible.  The authors voices breath the dusts of their deserts and antiquity. They give a window on civilized homes haunted by the twin shades of starvation and inexplicable disease.  They show us a world where warfare really meant covering your hands in the blood and entrails of your enemies.   As a Sunday School teacher I have turned back to this text often to provide context for understanding the ancient Hebrew's captors, allies, enemies, and neighbors and to understand the wrath of their God's intense jealousy.
