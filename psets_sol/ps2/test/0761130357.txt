I always try to reduce recipes because I don't know if the result will be well received and wasting ingredients is bad. I usually reduce it using one egg so this book is a reference for portions.  I haven't tried the recipes yet.  If a recipe works, I might keep the dough in the freezer but I find it's better to make small batches instead of storing excess when it comes to desserts.  It takes no time to whip up a favorite recipe.I wish that the author had used regular mini molds instead of tuna fish cans for her recipe portions.
