Despite the virtual tsunami of words that have been written about Nazi Germany, its antecedents, and World War II, Rise and Fall of the Third Reick remains a standout in the field, and truly qualifies as a must read for anybody who is seriously interested in this era.Shirer's massive work (1143 pages in the paper edition) is particularly good on the pre-war years and the rise of Hitler and Nazism, when Shirer was for many of those years stationed as a correspondent in Berlin.  The book is noticeably thinner on events after the US enters the war, when Shirer departed Berlin.  Thus,the years 1942-1944 are covered in somewhat more summary fashion, with most of the attention focused on the major military battles of Europe and North Africa. Shirer also pays relatively short shrift to the Holocaust, which is something of an anomaly, because its full horrors were certainly well established by the time of his writing.The other great strength of Shirer's work is its vividness.  As a long-time correspondent in Berlin, Shirer, unlike so many of the subsequent historians who wrote of this period, had direct and personal knowledge of many of the Nazi leaders, and that knowledge informs his writing.  Although he makes no secret of his revulsion at all of the Nazi leadership, his particular disdain for Goering, Ribbentrop, and to a lesser extent, Goebbels, shines through clearly. That insight, combined with typical and illustrative repertorial detail, such as the weather at the time, what the local newspapers were reporting about the developments of the day, etc., give Shirer's work an immediacy that other historians simply cannot achieve.Shirer was not an historian by training.  Yet, because of its power, and because he was correct in the vast majority of his conclusions, his work stands up admirably against the works of professional historians.  If the subsequent passage of time and the opening of the formerly Russian archives have taught us anything, it is how right Shirer was about so many things, writing in the late 1950s.  Later historians, such as Richard Evans, have written more analytically, and in more typically scholarly ways, about Nazi Germany, and as I noted, others have had greater access to documents, but Shirer's broad themes have been validated by the test of time.As I have suggested, Shirer's work is not without flaws, but its weaknesses are utterly overwhelmed by its great strenghts.  This is a must read for people who want to understand World War II and its pre-history
