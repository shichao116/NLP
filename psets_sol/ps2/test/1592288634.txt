I started reading this-  a chapter each evening.   About a third of the way through, I got hooked and read straight through to the end in one sitting.    I don't normally come to Amazon to write reviews-  but this story is worth the read.   I enjoyed this more than Isaac's Storm by Eric Larson, which got a lot of press a few years back.   If you liked Endurance or the Johnstown Flood, you'll love this book
