I can't express how grateful I am to this author for this fabulous book!I was SO hungry before I got this!  My kids and I were longing for baked goods, but the storebought gluten free versions were gross and expensive.I can bake for my whole family (and picky relatives) out of this book and everyone is happy! In fact, I would even step out and say some of the recipes in this book turn out better than the conventional recipe counter-parts
