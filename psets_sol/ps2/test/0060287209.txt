In fact, I loved this book so much that I bought it two years ago and my first grandchild was only born last night.  And, even though the sentiments expressed in this dear book are mine exactly, the picture of the 'grandmother' on the cover looks more like a 'great-grandmother!'   This is my only criticism of the book.  So, when I inscribe the book (which I believe all books should be), I shall tell my son's lovely little girl that I really look a lot younger.This book is a love letter from a grandmother to her grandchild.  Fortunately, the gender is not revealed so it's perfect for a girl or a boy.  The grandmother is telling her grandchild that she thought about her (I'll say her since we have a girl), dreamed about her, wondered about her.   She tries to imagine how this precious baby looks, and even visualizes her crawling, sleeping, and seeing her first Christmas tree.The sweet last words of this book with the lovely pictures are, "When it was my turn, I held you close and rocked you and whispered, "I am your grandma and I love you."  I LOVED YOU EVEN BEFORE YOU WERE BORN!"  I can't wait to read this to my new granddaughter~~only she'll call me "Mormor"!  I wish my Swedish grandparents and mother were here to see this precious gift
