Kurt Vonnegut knows how to draw your attention, and it's often only after you've finished the book that you realize the level of seriousness that he was trying to portray.Having read Slaughterhouse-Five, Breakfast Of Champions, and A Man Without a Country, I was excited when heard about this one from my friend Eric.It's about a guy writing about the day the bombs were dropped on Heroshima and Nagasaki.  He's also telling his story of how he converted to Bokononism.In real life, Vonnegut is a notable humanist, and the cyncism of man-made religion is evident in these pages.  Bokonon is a religious leader who follows a few basic steps to creating a good religion.  He lives life as an outlaw voluntarily, and he admits from the beginning of the Books Of Bokonon that his religion is all lies.The plots seems to shallow out a bit in the middle (only slightly) but by the end you are flying through pages to find the ultimate fate of the wonderful and crazy characters.Dark humor on par with Catch 22, it is difficult to decipher what is meant as farce and what is absurd, but overall a highly entertaining read, and a very good take on organized religion
