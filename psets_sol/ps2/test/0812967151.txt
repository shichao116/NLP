I found this book both compelling and readable. Each of the essays were written by talented and skilled writers and the topics range from Jutland, a Turkish viewpoint of Gallipoli, origins of the flamethrower, the Paris Gun and it's myths, the origin of the term 'No Man's Land', the brutal battles at Ypre, the Somme, noted pilots and their daring adventures, some great insight into 'Black Jack' Pershing and his dealings with the Allied generals and his lady friends.These were edited from previously published MHQ magazine issues and should find a place on the book shelf of any WWI buff. Enjoy.
