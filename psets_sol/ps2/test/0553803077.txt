Sickened is a touching memoir that tells the story of a girl's (Julie's) childhood...or lack there of.  Her childhood was plagued by Munchausen's by proxy syndrome; a form of child abuse where a caretaker deliberately induces illness on a child by poisoning them or by other measures, or simply makes up symptoms of a child in order to satisfy their own need for attention and acknowledgement.  Julie's mother used a combination of inducing symptoms on Julie by giving her an array of pills, starving her, overworking her, and lying to doctors about false symptoms.  Her whole childhood was spent going from doctor to doctor trying to find one that would listen to her mother because "her child was sick" and "the other doctors were just not smart enough and did not care enough to finally find some answers."  Julie does not know how her mother is hurting her until one day she is in her college psychology class and the professor starts talking about Munchausen's by proxy syndrome.  As soon as Julie hears the professor, she snaps out of her daze...she can relate to everything he is saying!  It was a huge slap in the face for her to suddenly learn that she is not the sickly girl her mother has made her out to be, but that the mother she has listened to and trusted all her life has actually been hurting her.  Her mother had her brainwashed as a girl...Julie was always told she was just an ugly, sickly girl, so that is how Julie always perceived herself.  Once she learned that it was her mother that had the problem, and not her, she was able to move past this image and see herself as much more than the sad, sickly girl.This book takes a reader on an emotional roller coaster.  I found myself wanting to reach out and help Julie, to tell her what her mother was doing to her.  The book made a lasting impact on me by telling personal accounts of Julie on her different trips to hospitals; from her unneeded surgery to her mother begging the doctor to perform open heart surgery.  The book let a reader get inside Julie's head at all these times to find out what she was thinking, how scared and confused she was.  It pained me to read about her going through all the unnecessary pain.  Julie's stories make a very informative, non-fiction book attention-grabbing by evoking emotion in the reader.
