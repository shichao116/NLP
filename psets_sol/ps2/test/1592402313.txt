Schilling's title includes the phrase "My Lifelong Friendship" and it really rings true considering this sensitively written book and his ongoing creative projects which are done with respect and class (i.e., the DVD and Cd, ELvis, By the Presleys).Jerry takes us from a local football contest back in Memphis in '54, when the local-boy-who-made-good (with "Thats Alright, Mama") joined him in a huddle. Later, they met at the Oval Office.It's interesting that Schilling constantly prefaces his commentary on Presley with his own experiences - he always points out his own miscues - before he mentions different events, situations, where Elvis...coulda-shoulda-woulda.Besides being a quality book on E.P., we get a fascinating historical look at the the music and movie industries of the '60s and '70s; when creativity was encouraged, then stifled; when inspiration gave way to formula: Elvis doing what he could with stale scripts and light songs to go with them; hearing what happened to his music mixes when his new tune was played on the radio; watching a golden opportunity drop like a piano from the ninth floor when his Management disallowed him to co-star in "A Star Is Born", a project which may have finally gotten him him the due respect in Hollywood and consequently may have taken him off the road long enough for him to regain his health.This book brings to mind another respectful work on the subject, "Me 'N' Elvis", by Charlie Hodge and Charles Goodman, Castle Books, Memphis, Tennessee.The jacket art of the new book has a common picture of Elvis on the front cover and an unflattering shot of Jery Schilling on the back flap. A  large spilt-screen effect on the front would have been nice. JS has earned such a place in the Presley pantheon.
