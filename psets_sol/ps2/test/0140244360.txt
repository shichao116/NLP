In a time when so many authors simply whine about injustice, Raybon does something about it. But what she does isn't the usual attack-the-bad-guy stuff. Instead, she does something much more courageous: she forgives the bad guy. This is a book of encouragement, of hope, of rare character from someone who would have every right to seek revenge. Raybon has written a book that dares us all to look inside ourselves and to God in our quest for harmony with one another
