Originally published in 1938, it centers around five brothers who each have a unique quality. The First Chinese Brother has the ability to swallow the sea. The Second Chinese Brother has an iron neck. The Third Chinese Brother can stretch and stretch and stretch his legs. The Fourth Chinese Brother can not be burned. And the Fifth Chinese Brother can hold his breath indefinitely. It is when the First Brother is accused of a crime he did not commit, and sentenced to death, that each brother uses his unique ability to save him.Some parents may express concerns that the book's "racial stereotypes" were demeaning to Chinese People. Or, it contains descriptions of violent plots to execute five brothers. While the book does allude to execution, it is done in such a farcical manner, that most children will not read into it. The execution is relevant to the book's plot and helps emphasize what the tale was originally about--five brothers who love each other deeply and who use their uniqueness to help save their brother's life. This tale was my childhood favorite--and it is now my son's (7yr) favorite.
