This amazing book was a Coretta Scott King award winner. The book was sad because the police shot a black teenager in the middle of Central Park. The main theme is death and the beautifulness of death. I would recommend this book to any one who likes books with intense sadness. It is one of the best books I have ever read.  When you read it you get sucked in on the first page with, "You do not die. Your soul steps out of your body." This line confused me and put me into an "I need to read more" mood.  On the last line you start to feel all wobbly and a few spaces later you start shaking up an earthquake. A tear-flavored tsunami finishes it off. Then after you have finished the book you try to forget you read it as an excuse to read it over and over and over until you die!!!!
