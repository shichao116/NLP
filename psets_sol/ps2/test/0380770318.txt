I have been a librarian for 10 years, and I have never actually &quot;met&quot; Miss Zukas, but she is a very believable character.  I am a real mystery fan, and I loved this book.  So does everyone else who has read it!  This book, and its predecessor, Miss Zukas and the Library Murders, has been passed between about eight librarians all across the U.S. to gales of laughter and rave reviews.  Ms. Dereske's books have great characters,well- thought plots, and an engaging style.  Highly recommende
