This book is perfect for the age group stated (pre-K, K).  It doesn't go into details of what divorce is, but rather it acknowledges that something sad and a little scary has happened and that things have changed.  It addresses the fears that come along with divorce for little kids: anxiety, abandonment, concern for the parent who is leaving, visitation and continuity.  It does a great job of explaining that even though one parent no longer lives with you, they are still your mommy/daddy and will always love you.  I also liked that it stressed that even though some things have changed, some things have remained the same; the little girl still gets to sleep with her favorite bunny no matter which house she's at, she can still wear her favorite shoes and she can still do the things she loves to do with each parent.  It also briefly covers the fact that sometimes when Daddy was supposed to come pick them up on the weekends he couldn't, but was sure to come see them on a different day (acknowledging that visitation isn't always on a perfect schedule so expect some bumps, but rest assure daddy still loves you and wants to see you).  It's a simple book but it gets the message across.  I would have liked to have seen the children as a boy and a girl though instead of two girls so it might appeal to little boys and give them someone to identify with that is in their same situation.
