I felt that this book was for the most part an easy read. There were times that I felt that it was hard to stay with the writer, but mainly because I was anxious for the facts. My advice is be patient. If you do want to increase your chances for having either sex then you really need to read the whole book. Although you could skip ahead to the chapter that explains how to try to conceive each sex, but honestly you will be missing a bunch of helpful tips throughout the book. We are hoping it will increase our chances of the sex gender we'd like to have first this Spring! Be sure that you will be happy with either sex. Do NOT depend on this book to work miracles. The book merely tells you how to increase your chances of having either sex.Good luck
