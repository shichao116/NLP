Being new to NLE editing, I bought Premiere Pro and this book.  Unfortunately, the books simply tells the user to click this, and drag that.  But it does not say WHY the user is doing these actions.  I could follow most of the examples in the book, but couldn't figure out how to actually use the program for my own projects!  For me, I need an explanation of why I'm supposed to click/drag/type instead of a "march-in-lockstep" and don't ask why mentality
