This is a reprint of Radford's 1909 Plan Book and (may I one day be forgiven for saying this, but), some of these houses were ugly. I mean really and truly UGLY.But some of them weren't so bad. If you were a wanna-be homeowner (almost) 100 years ago, you'd peruse the pages and pick out a house that suited your needs and your pocketbook. Then you'd send in a few bucks (typically $5 or so) and receive a full set of blueprints that you'd use to build your dream house.The quality of this reprint is good and this is a fun read, if for no other reason than to get an idea of the evolution of American architecture.Roseauthor, The Houses That Sears Builtco-author, California's Kit Home
