This publisher has collected in two volumes all of Gogol's short stories.  Volume 1 contains Gogol's early work, including his first two books of  stories. Several of the stories are good, but there are only two real gems  here: &quot;Ivan Schponka and His Aunt&quot; and &quot;Diary of a  Madman.&quot; Volume 2 contains the real classics: &quot;The Nose&quot;,  &quot;The Overcoat&quot;, etc
