Michael Chabon's excellent introduction alone makes this book worth its price.  Once again he basically asks, "What's wrong with actually ENJOYING a story?"  As if the only stories worthwhile - those considered "literary fiction" - must be so abstract and esoteric that the only pleasure in reading them comes from a smug sense of accomplishment merely for getting through them.However, this isn't Chabon's best of all time - they are the best of the year.  I found the results a bit hit-and-miss, but fortunately there were more hits than misses.
