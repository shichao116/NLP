Love this book, saw improvements within the first hour of reading it.  I love the breakdown of the whole head into parts, then the parts are broken down even further.  I was also impressed with the "common mistakes" referred to in the book that were my common mistakes!Very usable information, not too technical, and in addition to helping pin down the emotion you're trying to add to a face, it contains a lot of practical advice to improve the overall "realistic" look of a portrait.
