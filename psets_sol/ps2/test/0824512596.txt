In the Name of Jesus Henri Nouwen describes what Christo-centric, servant leadership is all about.  He states, "Much Christian leadership is exercised by people who do not know how to develop healthy, intimate relationships and have opted for power and control instead."  Nouwen's leadership focus is on building God's Kingdom and not our own.  The book is very short but is packed full of crucial teachings for current and future leaders.  The newest edition features a helpful study guide with about 10-12 stirring questions.
