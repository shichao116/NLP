Eric Schlosser performs a great service with his well composed description of the industrial food system that feeds most Americans.Schlosser starts with a history of the founding of many of the famous fast food chains in the U.S.Carl Karcher (Carl's Jr.), Richard and Maurice McDonald (McDonald's), Dave Thomas (Wendy's), and Harland Sanders (Kentucky Fried Chicken)all have remarkable tales of hard work and enterprise in the founding of their restaurants.Schlosser then goes on to describe the working conditions for the modern employees of these restaurants and how the major fast-food chains prey on the uneducated workforce as a source of disposible cheap labor.The author also covers the conditions under which the cattle are raised to provide beef for this vast agro-industrial complex. He also outlines dangers of modern industrial beef - antibiotics, toxic bacteria, high fat content, etc.Continuing in his inquiry into our food chain, Schlosser covers the working conditions of slaughterhouse and meatpacking workers.Throughout the book, the facts are well presented and well referenced. The endnotes and index are both thorough and useful. On the whole, I enjoyed the book and learned much
