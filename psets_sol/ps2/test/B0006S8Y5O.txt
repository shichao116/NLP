I'm a 65-year old single grandparent (grandfather) raising an adopted 9-year old grandaughter and understandably apprehensive about the coming years with their profound changes.  Having read Reviving Ophelia (highly recommended) but looking for something to address the more personal issues of adolescency I stumbled upon this title.  It is simply the greatest book at the perfect time.  Even though we are very close my "daughter" admits that there are subjects that the book addresses that she was curious about and that I tended to avoid for obvious reasons.  What amazes me is that I have told several mothers of her playmates about this book and every one has begged me to borrow it.  Invariably they admit to being unsure about how or when to address the questions that all young girls have in the back of their minds about the physical changes about to be thrust upon them and even fear about what to say when "that moment" comes.  I have "sneaked" several looks at the book and I can say that it is spot-on and very well written with great lighthearted illustrations.  Get this book for your pre-pubescent daughter (or grandaughter!)...you won't be sorry.  As Siskel and Ebert would say..."Two Thumbs Up!"
