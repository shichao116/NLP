I bought this book for my children and they love it from ages 18 mos to 4 years!  The story is adorable, cute and funny and the illustrations are just about the best I've ever seen. However, because of that, I would hightly recommend not buying the board book as I have done.  It is much too small to do the illustrations justice and you lose out on the fine detail of the drawings...I will be purchasing the larger book so that we can more fully enjoy the pictures
