In reading "Rhetoric at the Boundaries," I've learned a lot I hadn't considered in the past, specifically dealing with transitions between major and minor sections of text. Longenecker's book has helped me greatly in thinking about how sections transition from one to another.In the first section of his book, Longenecker actually takes the time to explain some different sorts of transitions that one comes across in Greek text of the New Testament period. He examines excerpts of Quintillian and of Lucian of Samosata, showing that the "chain-link" transition is something that was accepted rhetorical style of this period. He examines other non-canonical sources to establish that this transition style was used in different genres and by different writers.Longenecker then applies his focus to the New Testament, and this is the most interesting part. He identifies and elaborates upon several instances of the chain-link transition in various NT books and shows how they have been mis-identified and (in several instances) mishandled by many previous interpreters. These worked examples (for Romans, Gospel of John, the Apocalypse, and Acts) provide a good basis for understanding this type of structure.Longenecker only examines a subset of potential links of this type, but he lays the proper foundation for identification and examination of these sorts of things. Looking back, I wish I'd read this before I started Ray Van Neste's "Cohesion and Structure in the Pastoral Epistles," because Van Neste spends a lot of time examining transitions (the "boundaries" in Longenecker's title) for cohesion between sections. And there are times where Van Neste identifies chain-link transitions without calling them by that label.If you're into discourse analysis, rhetoric, studies of textual cohesion, studies having to do with redaction criticism, or just working your way through the Greek text of a particular NT book, then you should consider reading Longenecker's work
