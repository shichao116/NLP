I treated myself to this book for its relationship with and inclusion of many subjects of my interest:  photography, folk & bluegrass music, roots culture, beat culture, NYC 60s art culture, & exotic travel.  When I read the description here, I thought, "wow, this sounds like one hell of a great book, tailored to my passions."  Well, it's better than that.  John Cohen is one lucky guy to have witnessed & recorded all that's in this book.  The text is adequately sparse (for a 200-page book), but well-written and provides just enough accompaniment for the fascinating photography reproduced here.  Regardless the title, looking through John Cohen's eyes is an ecstatic experience, taking one away to seemingly faraway times and places, especially for someone who was born in the 1970s (me).  There is a story within each image, and the large scale of the prints makes you want to crawl inside each one and figure out what's going on.  It's an Italian-made book, which explains the high quality; and it's the best ($) I've spent since Dylan was last in town
