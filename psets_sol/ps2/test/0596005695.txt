This book is written for linux/unix sysadmins, not programmers. The topic of iptables is intimately related to guarding a network against intruders. A sysadmin task. Plus, the compact, pocketbook size lends itself to a common scenario.You're a harried sysadmin in the machine room of your company, surrounded by racks of computers and cabling. Equipment everywhere and little room for you to prop up a regular sized text on intrusion detection. Quite possibly, the master console is some cheezy old monitor that you got stuck with. Or even worse, it is just a terminal. If the latter, it's really awkward to do a man on iptables and also run it, especially if you're in real time mode against an active intruder. In other words, what this book is ideal for.
