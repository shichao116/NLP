I'm a lawyer who is considered a wordsmith by colleagues and judges.  This is one of the most important books I've ever encountered.  I was exposed to it in my first law school year's writing class, and its lessons have remained with me since.  Banish the passive voice! (unless deliberately and thoughfully chosen and used).  This is not merely a key to fluidity in writing, but in a sense a moral imperative.  Actions are attributable to actors - they don't simply occur.  If you're asserting an action took place, you and your reader should know who or what you claim set it in motion.  This necessitates intellectual rigor and clarity.  Also, I remember and have employed for twenty-five years Wydick's apt metaphor that good legal writing is like fine cabinetmaking: the skill of the craftsman is shown by the crafted joints not requiring glue, just as the quality of a piece of prose is shown by its lack of reliance on "glue words" (read the book).  I've used the lessons of Wydick's brief book as a lawyer, writer and writing teacher.  I've given it to colleagues, non-lawyers and young relatives.  Their writing uniformly improved.
