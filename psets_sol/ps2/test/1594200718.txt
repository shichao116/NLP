As a designer in NYC  I really appreciated the detailed and accurate illustrations. Very well done & I think the book has enough information to be able to come back to it multiple times and come away with something new.  I would take issue with the idea that its for a child/teenager.  Visually it can spark a lot of ideas that can become useful.  Now that I think about it, it reminds me of when I was a kid reading and staring at the illustrations from the Richard Scary book series.
