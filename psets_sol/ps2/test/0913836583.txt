_The Orthodox Way_ by Bishop Timothy Ware is a brief but excellent introduction to Eastern Orthodox mysticism and doctrines.  A monk recommended this book to me as a supplement to Ware's other notable introduction to Orthodoxy, _The Orthodox Church_.  While _The Orthodox Church_ is an objective historical study written when Ware first converted to the Church, _The Orthodox Way_ deals with more personal theological experience.  It is structured into six chapters each dealing with a different aspect of God: Mystery, Trinity, Creator, Man, Spirit, Prayer and Eternity.  The chapter on "Mystery" deals with the revelatory character of man's relationship with God and the ultimate bridge that separates the creation from the creator.  Men, as created beings, cannot partake or understand the Essence of God but can partake of divine, uncreated energies.  God has often been described by mystics as "divine darkness" or "cloud of unknowing."  "Trinity" focuses on the Father, the Son or Logos and the Holy Spirit as the three persons of God.  They are each distinct from one another yet share the same divine essence.  The chapter on "Creator" describes God as being in all things-not pantheism but panentheism.  God is in all things yet remains beyond all created things as well.  The "God as Man" chapter focuses on Jesus Christ as Incarnate God.  Ware contends that Christ not only died for our sins but also suffered along with humanity, not just in place of it.  "God as Spirit" relates the Church's doctrines and experiences of the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Trinity.  The Spirit has been symbolized by a dove and flames of fire, and is described in the Bible as the "Breath" of God, because of His mysterious and intangible nature.  Ware notes from example from the Gospel, the Holy Spirit revealed Jesus Christ as God, while at the same time Christ's ministry heralded the coming of the Spirit to divinely guide humanity through the Church at Pentecost.  Ware elaborates further on the mystical union between humanity and Divinity in "God as Prayer."  Ware mentions the Hesychast tradition of silent, continuous prayers as well as the practice of spiritual leadership by "God-bearing elders" (starets) and "Fools for Christ."  The former guide individuals by various gifts of Divine grace, while the latter forsake all worldly comforts and possessions as a radical example of the Gospel to the faithful.  Ware's concluding chapter on "God as Eternity" explains how souls in Heaven will have a dynamic relationship, one that becomes ever closer to God throughout eternity.  This may sound strange but it is entirely possible because God is by definition eternal and infinite and therefore no created entity can ever totally partake of God's divine essence itself.Ware's book is not totally without controversy.  For one, it draws on a lengthy number of un-Orthodox sources to prove his points (like Thomas Merton, William Blake, etc.) and supplement his dialogue, in addition to ecclesial authors whose validity have been questioned like Origen.  Probably the most controversial section is where Ware discusses the nature of Satan and the fallen angels before the physical earth was created.  Is it possible that Satan will be redeemed in a universal forgiveness (as was originally maintained by Origen and Gregory of Nyssa)?  Does Satan serve an ulterior purpose in God's plan that is unknown to humans?  According to Ware, it is possible that Satan will be redeemed (although of course not definite) because God's love is universal and unconditional.  The traditional Orthodox opinion is that Satan is condemned to the lake of fire in hell at the last judgment as related in the Apocalypse.  Ware also takes a positive view of Hell.  Hell is not necessarily a state of total abandonment of soul by God (as has often been articulated in various theological traditions) but is a sort of "fire of divine love."  I.e., Hell is God's love experienced in a negative way but nevertheless God's love.I recommend this book as an introduction to themes in Orthodox mysticism and doctrine.  There are other titles that can be recommended that explore these topics in more precise detail: _The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church_ (Vladimir Lossky) and the works of Pseudo-Dionysius.
