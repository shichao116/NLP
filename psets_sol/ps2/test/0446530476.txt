I read Teach With Your Strengths which is also from the Gallop Poll.  I really enjoyed it, so I purchased this book for my husband who is in sales.  We both were able to take the "Strengths Finder" to learn our top 5 strengths and how we can best use them to become successful in our professions.  I read both, and they are great.
