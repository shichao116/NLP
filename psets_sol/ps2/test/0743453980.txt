This formulaic thriller tells the story of Muslim terrorists sneaking a nuke into the US with intentions to detonate it during Memorial Day ceremonies in DC. Returning hero, Mitch Rapp, the top counterterrorist expert and former field agent/killer, must race against time to foil the plot. While a bit jingoistic in its patriotism (there is no question who the good guys and bad guys are), this is Flynn's best book to date. It is fast paced and action-packed. It helps that Rapp's whinny, insecure wife Anna doesn't appear in this novel. Rapp is still a bit too arrogant, pushy, hot-headed, and condescending; makes it somewhat difficult for the reader to totally like the hero of the book. I don't think this was the intention of the author, just a result of bad writing. However, it was very entertaining.
