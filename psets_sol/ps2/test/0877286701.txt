This is a very deep book whose values magnifies with one's exposure to Hatha, Gnana and Raja Yoga to name but three disciplines. The student of comparative religions whose background is well-versed in magick, myth and religion (either through a minor in Anthropology as myself and/or continued studies for over a dozen years) will discover that this Onion has infinite layers to peel.The dilemma arises in the confusion the work brings through various citations and one doesn't have those resources immediately available to them. It is unrealistic to understand the volume of subject matter this collection of works covers without acquiring these materials. Whether in hardback, paperback or digital--it doesn't matter which--if you want to understand this book and grasp the many scientific metaphysical concepts embedded within the Tree it is a requirement to have a majority of them to get the most out of their Qabalistic constructs.If you start from a philosophical and scientific mind you will be better prepared to understand the connections presented in this collection. If you achieve one goal it would be to understand mythology and how it relates to the human psyche
