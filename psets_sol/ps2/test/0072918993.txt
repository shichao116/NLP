This book is used as the textbook for the core operationsclasses in the MBA program at Wharton. As the classes followedthe outline of the book pretty closely it has been a greatsupplement for the course.I also think that anybody who has to deal with operations sideof businesses would benefit from this book as it offers greattools for everyday business use. The book is well structured,easy to follow and full of relevant examples from moderncompanies.I have been able to use many of the concepts introduced in thebook both in my subsequent MBA classes and business.Highly recommend it
