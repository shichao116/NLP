In this very interesting and useful book, the author shows how collaboration creates value in business.  This is unlike other boring business books I've read, this one's easy to read, well-illustrated, and thought-provoking. This book gives real-world examples from a variety of different industries and shows that a collaborative organizational culture is what sets apart large companies like Toyota, Boeing and Procter & Gamble.  Rosen also includes DreamWorks Animation, Industrial Light & Magic, the Mayo Clinic, the Myelin Repair Foundation and others.  Besides culture, the author covers tools, processes and workplace environment. I highly recommend this book
