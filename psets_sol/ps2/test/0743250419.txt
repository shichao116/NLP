Alas, Toibin hits Henry James' tone right. I have an ambiguous attitude towards James. I like him better as a subject of novels than as a novelist. He is an interesting person not because he has an own life, which he has not, but because he is like a sponge absorbing all lives around him. It works well in Gore Vidal's Washington, where HJ has a supporting role. It works very well in this masterpiece of a literary novel, a book about books, which is actually a biography, or maybe vice versa.HJ's language creates special atmospheres, I would almost call it quarantine zones. It hides its subjects through its opaqueness, yet manages to be elegant at the same time.Toibin re-creates HJ's language in telling his life, focusing on a mid life period, starting from a crisis after a failed theater project, through flash backs and meditations, but also carrying forward until the end of the century.It works very well. I may even try to read the master himself again. I had given up on that some time ago.The language is definitely a huge stumbling block for fast readers. I wonder if there are any of those people interested in this kind of literature at all.HJ's art is mischieviously summarized as "the art of fiction as a cheap raid on the real and the true". Some people around him object to his way of absorbing "stories" from real life, while not leading a life of his own. HJ comes across as a manipulator and vampire. At the same time his language builds social barriers. The theater audience reacts typically: the general public jeers, only the invited friends applaud.HJ is a person who will not commit himself. The Oscar Wilde trial is used to reflect on HJ. He is assumed to have similar inclinations, but he will not get involved in anything. He does not have the courage to commit himself. A flashback incident indicates that some basis for such assumptions were there, but the man will not come out of the closet. More open is a later incident with a similar dead end.Two important women in his life, his sister and a cousin, die young and tragically and their lives are re-cycled by HJ in stories and novels. That may be a normal process in literature, but one wonders.A central story with the same theme is his friendship with a female novelist, who becomes his "best friend", and who is deserted by him. She commits suicide and he behaves like an ice cold monster, both before and after her death.This novel is a complete masterpiece and entirely satisfying.It deserves six stars
