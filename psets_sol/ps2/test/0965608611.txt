This book does what its supposed to, which may sound a bit like a left handed compliment, but that's actually quite an accomplishment in the genre of college guidebooks. It actually gives good useable information about what to expect, and how to navigate, college. And it does it in a clear way. So many similar books are substance free. Or get mired in trying to use 'hip' language. This one is usable and cogent. I reccomend it highly
