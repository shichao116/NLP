I bought this book because I must own all by Woolf, as a matter of need rather than want--or so I feel. Although I'm able to recognize the shortcomings (far less than my own) that inevitably accompany experimental, modernist work, my opinion of her genius is curiously immune to these objective observations. She is like my literary mother, so I was chastised never to have known this novel existed until I began reading it.As far as form and structure go, I feel Woolf tries too hard to be conventional: she can't ever quite fit into it properly, and you realize why it took her so long to complete the book. As always, however, she is a master of the character, something I didn't realize until the end, where every character is felt so strongly that I almost cried. I know.However awkward the overall construction may be, and however much it may drag, you feel the beginnings of her future craft. The climax is it, where she finally catches the pace and throws you mercilessly against the ridiculously shallow aspect of everyday life. And the arbitrary but crushing beauty of love. I dreamt about it for days afterward
