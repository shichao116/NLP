This book is a fun read about bees.  Definetly not a technical manual, so I don't know why the "How to Keep them" part of the title got added on.  There's a lot of good historical information about bees, biological information, and some tricks of the trade from Sue who is a commercial beekeeper in the Ozark Mountains.  She shares some great stories about her life, which is intricately woven with the lives of her bees.
