I very much enjoyed the vehement imbicility of the various negative/derogative reviews that have been belched forth so vitrolicly against Deloria's superb work: Evolution, Creationism, and Other Modern Myths: A Critical Inquiry. O how the indoctrinated do howl when their sacred cows are set upon by wolves of the mind like Deloria!The basic issue in relation to Deloria's ideas, and the very same concept that Deloria's mudlarkian detractors so benightedly fail to grasp is simply that both Scientism and Creationism are world views wrought almost invisibly deep in the minds of those who are informed by them. In other words, people view the world, frame their experiences, and validate their conclusions based on their degree and brand-name of indoctrination. Scholars and academians bark as they are trained to bark, attack whom they percieve as a threat to the well-being of their beloved paradigm (base territorialism), and roll over and play dead when instructed to by their paymasters.Take two zygotic twins. Raise one a Christian and place that one in a Bible college. Take the other and raise it as a scientific atheist, send it to get a degree in science. The result? Two victims of brainwashing who both hold their views as catagorical.Remember, to someone who knows, no proof is necessary. To someone who refuses to know, no proof will suffice. Deloria simply shows the truth as it really is - as a matter of relationship; and that "validity" is as much or more an issue of cultural psycho-programming as it is of the "facts" and "laws" of physical reality.
