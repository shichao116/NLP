I was very pleased with this book.  I felt like it was pretty much right on.  I am one of those in a companionate marriage, that has tettered on divorce a couple of times.  It has been very difficult keeping it together.   The most desireable of marriages and it seemed the most happy was the  romantic catogory of Marriage.  If I ever decide to leave this marriage  after 30 yrs, that will be the type I will look for in a relationship.  Too  much emotional emptiness in the compantionate marriage
