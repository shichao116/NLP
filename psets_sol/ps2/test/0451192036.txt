This is a non fiction book but it reads quickly like a novel, partly because its told in I narrative and instead of concentrating on facts and statistics John Griffen focuses on his emotional journey as a white man traveling as a black in the deep south.Before reading it i knew what racisim was of course, and i've read books on this time period and since about racisim but this was the first book that really made it real for me. This has to do mainly because he had a white man's perspective, or a perspective of being one of the opressors and switching to one of the opressed.It is also amazing what John Griffen did- turning his skin color black, traveling through the south, and then later reporting on what he found even though he knew he would jeopardize himself and his family. It took a lot of bravery and not many would do it. He changed his whole identity at the cost of losing it.This book can relate to any situation where one group is being degraded because of their skin color, religion, etc. John Griffen's views of how racisim plays out and how it affects the whole society are timeless.Everyone should read this, it only takes a short time, its not a long book, but the book's impression and story will stay with you for a long time after.
