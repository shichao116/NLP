I took a webinar based on this book and found the information presented intriguing enough to buy the book.  It's a short read but filled with good, practical information.  If there are certain people in your lives who rub you the wrong way, understanding how their style differs from yours could help to improve communication and make the relationship more effective and pleasant for both.  This book was definitely worth reading and I've experienced benefits from it at work in a very short time
