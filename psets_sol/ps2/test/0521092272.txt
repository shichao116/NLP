This is simply one of the best math books I've ever read. I've never seen any better definitions of limits, derivatives, and integrals. Although the notation is a wee bit outdated and confusing at times (full of phis, psis, deltas et cetera), this book was very easy to understand, which is weird considering I'm only 15, a junior and in Pre-Calculus. But this book means AP Calculus should be very easy for me next year..
