Another great book by Tim LaHaye.  I particularly liked the perspective of the Rapture from Heaven.  I always get excited and am ready for the Rapture after reading LaHaye's books.  I was afraid that it would be a repeat of Left Behind but there was just enough overlap to keep things in context.What's next
