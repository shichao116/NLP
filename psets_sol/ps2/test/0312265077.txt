This is one of the few books which I have felt compelled to read more than once. The story is entertaining from front to back cover with Mr. Bahr managing to pull the reader along with a writing style that is unique and engaging. I found the characters believable and the action intense. Mr. Bahr delivers a strong story without giving in to predictable sentimentalities that plague so many novels of this type.I recommend this book to anyone interested in a good story, not only those with an interest in American Civil War history
