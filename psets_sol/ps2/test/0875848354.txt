This book is a MUST HAVE for every manager or student who still believes that much has to be known about what is coming to us in the  XXI Century. Anyone who has heard or met Dick Nolan, a Professor at the HBS, is very aware of his down to earth, creative, and witty mind. He will be part of Management History and this is not an understatement since, in my view, he already is. He brought, in 1974, IT to the minds of the Directors at Boradrooms by his &quot;Stage by Stage Theory,&quot; nowadays commonly accepted by everyone. He foresaw the need for Strategy to meet IT and the Humanities. His previous 1996  book  &quot;Creative Destruction&quot; led the way for others to recently follow the field, ideas, and even the book title. He went on to build Nolan Norton &amp; Co., a Management Consulting Firm that everyone has been trying to copy without success. In this new book, once again, Dick et. al. compiled the best thoughts he alreday had before &quot;the internet bubble.&quot; He waited to get this book published because he dosen't like to be seen as a forecaster. However, whatever he says, will be done in the future by every sustainable business. His thoughts and wisdom have created a school of thought from which even the Balanced Scorecard came to be a reality in  1988
