Following his graduation from Moody Bible Institute, Ray Bakke found himself propelled from "rural Washington to inner-city Chicago".  This book traces his journey, and combines his experience of the city -- Chicago in particular -- with his own theological reflection.  The end product is an unusual mix -- yet it works.  Being an inner-city minister myself, I felt that Bakke deeply understands ministry in the city.The city, considers Bakke, is no bad place.  It is not the case that "all cities are evil".  Rather, a city might be described as a "magnificent ruin'".  It is a ruin on account of its being "sin-scarred", yet it is magnificent for the reason that, in the city, "there have been ministries of such splendor and significance".  This having been said, city ministry is not merely about human activity, as so many theologies would seem to imply.  Above all, it is about "our God as One who engages in external-world activity".  The city is the story of "God's surprising interventions"."I acknowledge Scripture to be the final test", writes Bakke.  With this in mind, he considers that there are two distinct "spiritualities" in the Bible -- both evangelism and social engagement.  Therefore "what God has brought together, let no one put asunder".  The righteous, he writes, "are called to be both salt and light . . . the twin vocations of the Christian".  He broadly surveys the theology of Scripture, its example, and the example of Church history, to make what would seem to be a strong case for the Christian's twofold calling.  He considers that this is, on the whole, "beneficial to the security and salvation of individual persons".A modern city, writes Bakke, will typically contain many ethnicities.  He approaches the subject from the point of view that God makes loving and providential use of ethnicity to proclaim salvation to the world. One need only think of Pentecost, or the prophets and teachers at Antioch (Acts 13:1).  He suggests modern examples, and further welcomes the influx to Western cities of many who belong to "the Orthodox family of Churches".  He comments: "Isn't it amazingly gracious of our God to bring our ancient Christian leaders to be side by side with us in Western cities . . . ?"  We can be greatly enriched through them."Over 50% of people on the planet", notes Bakke, will by now live in cities.  For this reason, it is crucial to develop an appropriate attitude towards ministry in the city.  In this, I feel that he succeeded.  This was a warm-hearted and refreshing book.  My sentiment on completing  it is:  "Thank God for Ray Bakke."  He has surely done city ministry a great service.  My only question is why this book should not yet have reached a Second Edition.
