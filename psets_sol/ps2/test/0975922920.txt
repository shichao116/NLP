Horrors Beyond was published just this year by Elder Signs Press.  I got the hard cover and it has very high production qualities.  It is cloth bound, with a handsome slip cover.  There is a gorgeous cover painting by Dave Carson, filled with creepy visions of skull like things, images suggestive of the movie Alien and a Cthulhoid tentacled creature.  Page count is 281.  The slipcover has excerpts from a few stories.  There are minibios of the authors at the end of the book.  Otherwise there is no introduction or editor's notes.  The collection was edited by William Jones, who edits the Book of Dark Wisdom.  I subscribe but I am not otherwise familiar with his work.  So far I have to say that Elder Signs is a class act.  I like the production qualities of my trade paperback Ancient Exhumations +2, and the craftsmanship used in the magazine The of Book of Dark Wisdom.  Based on these I preordered The Hive and I am eager to get it.  The also have an upcoming anthology by Lupoff with at least some mythos stories.Horrors Beyond contains 18 stories.  All of them are newly published in this anthology, except Experiencing the Other by Ann K. Schwader.  Here are the contents:"The Eyes of Howard Curlix" by Tim Curran"His Wonders in the Deep" by William Mitchell"The Breach" by Lee Clark Zumpe"Experiencing the Other" by Ann K. Schwader"The Candle Room" by James S. Dorr"A Little Color in Your Cheeks" by Mike Minnis"One Way Conversation" by Brian M. Sammons"After the War" by Tony Campbell"The Blind" by Gerard Houarner"The Hades Project" by John Sunseri"A Form of Hospice" by Richard Gavin"The Prototype" by Ron Shiflet"False Containment" by David Conyers"Dingbats" by Richard A. Lupoff"The Orion Man" by Doug Goodman"Vuuduu" by C.J. Henderson"Cahokia" by Cody Goodfellow"The Name of the Enemy" by William JonesA very impressive author list!  The inclusion of works by such fine writers is another measure of the care taken with publishing this book.  The premise of the collection is to write about what may be occurring just beyond sight of our experience, between or beyond the edges of reality, hidden in shadows or sneaking through the cracks between dimensions.  Although not specifically a mythos collection this theme is central to Lovecraft's world (yes, I know that HPL is not the onlywriter who wrote along these lines, but I'm a fan of mythos fiction), and many of the stories directly use mythos ideas or are inspired by or informed by Lovecraft.  As a consequence this collection is of direct interest to fans of mythos fiction.The short version of my opinion is that this is a terrific book and all mythos fans should read it!Minor to major spoilers about the individual stories may follow."The Eyes of Howard Curlix" by Tim Curran  - I have read one other story by Tim Curran, "The Chattering of Tiny Teeth" in Warfear, a delightfully creepy exploration of ghouls residing in No Man's Land during WWI.  This new story concerns a tabloid journalist who interviews a scientist who has found a way to perceive the worlds that we cannot perceive because our vision is limited to a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum, and how our perception of what dwells there allows it to perceive us.  This was a very well written tale, a great way to kick off the anthology.  No mythosian entities but an overt nod to Abdul Alhazred."His Wonders in the Deep" by William Mitchell  - This is the first story by William Mitchell that I have read.  In this story a bereaved doctor attempts to resurrect his wife and family lost at sea.  Not directly mythosian, but entities lurk around the fringes who attempt to use human fear to make a passage into our universe.  Well written, enjoyable."The Breach" by Lee Clark Zumpe  - I am not familiar with any other work by Mr. Zumpe.  In this tale, a scientist attempts, alas successfully, to establish universes that exist parallel to our own.  The results are less than happy for all concerned.  Based on this story I would like the opportunity to read more of Mr. Zumpe's work."Experiencing the Other" by Ann K. Schwader - This is the only story to be previously published.  I first read it in Strange Stars and Alien Shadows.  It is a sequel to another story of hers, "Twenty Mile."  For me this was the biggest misfire of the anthology.  The story is good enough, but it is so clearly a sequel to "Twenty Mile" that I don't think it stands alone all that well.  Furthermore, "Twenty Mile" was uncommonly fine, and "Experiencing the Other" suffers a bit by comparison.  Maybesomeone who never read her other stories would have a differentopinion, I dunno."The Candle Room" by James S. Dorr - Another author new to me,although I may seek out his collections in the future.  This story was also about contacting other life forms that want to come through to our world.  While enjoyable I did not like it as much as some of the others contained in the anthology.  I'm not sure why; the writing just did not grab me that much."A Little Color in Your Cheeks" by Mike Minnis  - Mr. Minnis is known to mythos fans for "The Prodigies of Monkfield Cabot" from Eldritch Blue (an OK prequel to "The Thing on the Doorstep"), "Salt Air" (a superb Yellow Sign story in the superb anthology Dead But Dreaming) and more recently "The Butcher of Vyones" (one of the very beststories in the excellent CAS tribute anthology, Lost Worlds of Space and Time).  Mike Minnis has been a very busy boy lately and we are all the richer for it.  The story in Horrors Beyond is a sequel to "The Colour Out of Space."  The first few pages were taken up by what wasbasically a synopsis of the Lovecraft story, already well known to all us fanatics.  So this part dragged for me.  The remainder was a wonderfully creepy depiction of a backwoods type who lives (for now) on the shore of the new Arkham reservoir.  The inevitable comparison is "The Colour Out of Time" by Michael Shea (which ran on a bit too long for my taste), although we (semi) eagerly await "The Colour Out of Darkness" by John Pelan."One Way Conversation" by Brian M. Sammons - Utterly superb!  This story alone was worth the price of the anthology.  Surely it is one of the finest Hounds of Tindalos stories ever.  I would love to get better acquainted with Mr. Sammons' fiction."After the War" by Tony Campbell - Another author new to me.  Iwould rate this story as OK, nothing special but enjoyable, from the straight up scifi 'humans vs muties' genre."The Blind" by Gerard Houarner - I don't recall reading any of Mr. Houarner's stuff before, but he is widely published so maybe I have.  This was not a mythos story per se but it was certainly written with the central theme of the anthology in mind, and as such has at least echoes of Lovecraft.  A junkie wants to escape her current reality or gain some insight into what is really real, and finds some aliens who will do this if they can rummage around in her experiences.  I thought this was a very effective piece of writing."The Hades Project" by John Sunseri - A new author to me.  This story was another very effective piece of writing, about an outré entity who has altered the memory of everyone on earth as it prepares to hunker down here for a feast, except that of our protagonist.  Not overtly mythos but a good nod in that direction."A Form of Hospice" by Richard Gavin - Mr. Gavin has a collection out from Rainfall but I have never read his work before.  Based on this story I think I will look up Charnel Wine from Rainfall Books.  A man with cancer tried to heal himself with dreams under the guidance of a new age type.  Alas, the healing is a sort of Faustian bargain with outré entities who want to take up residence.  As with many stories this is not directly mythos in that it does not deal with namedentities, but it certainly is a comfortable read for HPL fans.  It was a very enjoyable read."The Prototype" by Ron Shiflet - Mr. Shiflet is well to fans of HPL derived fiction.  I thought his story "Seduced' in Eldritch Blue was brilliant.  He has a story in a recent issue of The Book of Dark Wisdom that I haven't gotten around to reading yet.  And I guess we all have to wait to find out what happens to Lindisfarne Press to see if we see more of his stories in print.  "The Prototype" is a more straight up scifi look at some alien types distributing TVs that are actually means of egress into our world.  I could easily visualize this as anepisode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits.  One of my favorite aspects of Ron's writing is the way the characters jump off the page.  Non mythos but enjoyable."False Containment" by David Conyers - Mr. Conyers wrote a story that appeared in issue II of Dreaming in R'lyeh.  That story was "A Shared Romance" which was an absolutely wonderfulAustralian Yig story, the gem of the issue and worthy of widerdissemination.  Well David Conyers does it again.  "FalseContainment" is marvelous, maybe the best story in the book.  His take on the various properties of shoggoths results in a similar result to Cody Goodfellow in Ravenous Dusk or "Big C" by Lumley in Lovecraft's Legacy.  It is kind of cool to see how different authors thinking through a Lovecraftian creation can come up independently with a similar result.  I also like how Conyers thinks through what I call the Yog Sothoth problem, where this entity is contemporary with all time and is not limited by 3 spatial dimensions.  How would you interact with a creature like that?  This was addressed to a degree byAA Attanasio in "Glimpses" but Conyers' take is more like "As ISee It" by Greg Stolze in Delta Green: Dark Theaters.  All in all a very impressive effort!  I hope that Mr. Conyers is planning a great deal more mythos fiction."Dingbats" by Richard A. Lupoff - Lupoff is widely published but heck if I can recall reading anything by him before.  An OK scifi space story with echoes of many Star Trek episodes where an entity can manipulate your mind to fulfill your fantasy worlds."The Orion Man" by Doug Goodman - Doug Goodman was new to me.  "The Orion Man" was a nicely creepy story of a man who seems to be the only one who can see the truth of alien presences on earth, with certain constellation tattoos having special significance.  Not really mythos but I liked it."Vuuduu" by C.J. Henderson - Of course CJ Henderson has impeccable mythos credentials, is widely published and is active on ahc.  I pretty much have enjoyed everything I have read by CJ Henderson and I keep promising myself I will read his collection of occult detective stories that is sitting on my bookshelf.  "Vuuduu" reminds me of a story I read maybe 30 years ago; I forget both title and author, but someone inadvertently stumbled on a sonic frequency that put the listener intoa perfect state of contentment, so they didn't want to move or do anything.  Of course this was then used to take over the world.  Similarly but more topical for the early 21st century, Vuuduu is a music program that allows you to pirate any song.  Of course pretty soon everyone (but our protagonist) is listening to Vuuduu created tapes.  The end however has a nice twist on this sort of story.  Tightly written as you might expect but not really mythos."Cahokia" by Cody Goodfellow - If you don't recognize the nameCody Goodfellow it means you haven't read Radiant Dawn and that means you are cheating yourself out of one whale of a read, an absolute knock out.  The companion novel Ravenous Dusk was slightly more problematic but was also a page turner.  In "Cahokia" we find out what happened to all those civilizations, like the Cahokia mound builders, that vanished without a trace.  More pure scifi, with faintest echoes ofLovecraft, but an absorbing read."The Name of the Enemy" by William Jones - William Jones edits The Book of Dark Wisdom and edited this book, so thank you Mr. Jones!  Keep the good work up!  My impression of this book was more pure scifi, not particularly horror nor mythos.  How do you fight an unbeatable enemy?  A nifty read to finish out a great anthology.So in summary, this is a terrific collection.  I only mention what I construed as non mythos to allow the reader to decide if this is what they are looking for.  None of these stories were bad, most were excellent and at least 2 reached the heights of the finest mythos stories available.  The trade paperback price is very reasonable and I can't imagine any HPL fan not loving this book.  No need to wait, order it now!
