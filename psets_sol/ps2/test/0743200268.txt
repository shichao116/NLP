I'm a big fan of well written adventure books and books on natural history. The best of them transcend their subject matter to arrive at bigger truths about human nature, the world, and mankind's place in it. Sy Montgomery tries mightily to link her experience up with The Bigger Story, but never manages to do it. Her attempts to be profound become almost embarrassing after a while.Sy writes a nature column for the Boston Globe and it shows. Everything of interest she has to say in this book could have been said in a column or two. What she's done in this book is take that column and simply keep repeating it over and over and over. Thus we hear narrative after narrative from the locals about how the bufeo live in an enchanted underwater city and come up on land periodically to seduce women. We spend day after day in a boat with her exclaiming "There's one! And there's another one!" After a while I found myself thinking "Sy, you go out in the boat and look for the bufeo. I'll lounge here on the hotel veranda and have some refreshments until you get back. Have a nice time."Unlike some reviewers, I didn't find anything `magical' or particularly poetic about her descriptions of the environment. It's not that she's a bad writer - clearly she isn't - but  she describes things the way a columnist would describe an exotic local for readers planning their next vacation - the size of the trees, the depth of the water, the different kinds of plants and bugs and wildlife you may encounter, with some attempt to make it all sound beautiful.She does give some superficial history of the Amazon Basin,  a little evolutionary history of dolphins, some "highlights" types of descriptions of a couple of towns and villages - everything you need to know to enhance your vacationing experience. She meets a lot of people along the way and dutifully describes the physical appearance of most of them. She tries to instill a little personality in each of them but can't pull it off, so even these encounters take on the quality of "And then I met this tanned woman wearing khaki shorts who was interested in manatees."In the end, we have gone on a trip with Sy and visited a local market or two,  admired the opera house at Manaus, caught some glimpses of the pink dolphins, listened to various natives tell the same legend, went to the funeral of a drowned child, dodged a snake or two,  and got sweaty in the jungle. If you had any interest in pink dolphins before you started the book, you'll be over it by the time this trip ends
