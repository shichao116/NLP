Once again Michael Connelly proves he is top shelf when it comes to Crime Drama. I was first introduced to Connelly, like many; via the 2002 Clint Eastwood pseudo-flop "Blood Work". I had no desire to see another creation of Connelly whatsoever. A year later I was at a book signing for one of John Sandford's "Prey" books and he recommended I give Connelly another try. I picked up "The Poet" and that was all I needed. I can sum it up like this: No one writes flawed and F'ed up characters like Connelly. No one!Others have given you enough plot points of this book so I will skip that. I will say in "Echo Park", Harry Bosch is on top of his game (and to be honest, when has he not been??). Among other things, we are teased with another classic confrontation between Harry and his nemesis, former Deputy Chief Irving. Alas, it was not to be, but I can see a clash between these titans just over the horizon. Can you see it??? I know that you can.We are treated to the usual cast of characters including a special FBI agent from Harry's recent past as well as his partner, Kiz Ryder and others from the Open/Unsolved Unit. We are also reminded what a tool Jerry Edgar is. God is he useless.You cannot go wrong with a Michael Connelly book. Trust me, pick it up today.
