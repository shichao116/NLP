Anyone who knows me can tell you I'm obsessed with PEANUTS. It all started when I was two and instead of a china doll I forced my grandmother to buy me a stuffed Snoopy(which still sits on display in my curio cabinet along with my other PEANUTS collectibles) As I got older however, my 'obsession' with PEANUTS stemmed more from the situations the characters endured or how they were: obnoxious Lucy, dirty Pig Pen, etc. Everyone knows someone they can relate to as a PEANUTS character. My husband got me this book a few years ago, because I knew a lot about Charles Shultz, but of course not everything. I loved this book because it explains where he got many of the characters, from people he knew. Also, I just thought it awesome to get to know the story of someone I consider a hero
