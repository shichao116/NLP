Erik Larson is one of those rare authors who can keep the reader on the edge of his or her seat while combining two largely unrelated though fascinating stories. His 2003 "The Devil in the White City" was a stylistic triumph and Larson has returned to narrate a spellbinding chase across the Atlantic.While some might think it a huge stretch to parallel the lives of Guglielmo Marconi, the father of wireless communication and Hawley Harvey Crippen, the meek American ex-patriate doctor, (whose life outside the office is one for the history books) Larson toggles back and forth between the lives of these two men with amazing clarity and force. Given a penchant for narrative drama and wonderfully rich detail, the author succeeds in raising the stakes for Marconi and Crippen to intersect...not physically, but in a related manner that spells doom for one man and bestows a certain public recognition on the other.Marconi's story is the less intriguing although the better known. His early professional failures were often met with derision and his personal life was fraught with sadness due mostly to his decided immaturity and aloofness. Charming in public, he be cold and crass when the doors were bolted. Crippen, on the other hand, was beholden to his long-suffering wife, Belle Elmore, whose attempts at a stage career were not met with much public approval. The dutiful doctor-husband saw to Belle's demanding needs... until he "ran out of patience".The final chapters dealing with the hunt for Crippen as he tries to escape to Canada are well worth the read. Larson skillfully builds the drama through a series of puckish side characters. In one of the great ironies, Crippen is said to have admired "the wireless antenna.....from the Marconi cabin"  while aboard the SS Montrose (his escape vehicle). Crippen exclaimed, "what a wonderful invention it is!" Captain Henry George Kendall, in on the sting, "could only smile and agree"."Thunderstruck" is a terrific addition to the growing list of "buckle-your-seat-belt" books by Erik Larson. It's a great way to spend a few hours reading about Marconi and Crippen, given the historical context of the times and Larson's way with words
