As a professional Gemologist having studied gems extensively and also someone who helps instruct already certified gemologist, aspiring gemologist, gem and jewelry retailers (many are not gemologists), gem cutters, hobbyist and consumers, I find Gem Identification Made Easy to be a very worthwhile purchase. It is comprehensively informative, accurate, resourceful, inspiring, and articulate as appropriate for the intended audience with a wide diversity of gemological knowledge. And, it's fun! Let's face it, gems, and jewelry containing them, are expensive toys, and though the money used to purchase them are typically discretionary, I don't know anyone who wants to pay for something that is not what it is represented to be. Very good, basic gemological information contained in this book will pleasingly educate the reader of any of the categories above, but can also potentially save the reader from mistakes worth multiple orders of dollar  magnitude beyond the cost of the book (or the recommended basic tools which it explains how to use). The 3rd Edition provides updates that deal with new treatment processes, new synthetics and simulants and gemological evidence that will aid in their identification. I have many reference books on gemology in my library, and I proudly display and use this one. Highly recommended
