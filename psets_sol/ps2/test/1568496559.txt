I'm a big time James Bond fan.  I've seen all the movies, read all the Benson and Gardner books and love the new Casino Royale movie starring Daniel Craig. Casino Royale is the story that started it all, and the book chosen to be the starting point for rebooting the entire movie franchise.  One can't help having the movie in your mind when you begin to read this short novel. When you read Bond, you'll see Daniel Craig, when you read Vesper, you'll see Eva Green.  When you read the book, you'll see the movie, because the plots are so similar.  If you haven't seen the movie, then beware, because the plots are similar.It doesn't make any since to judge Casino Royale by the same standards of novels written today.  This book is over fifty years old, very short and breaks many of the modern rules of writing.  But, this is a James Bond novel and a must read for any Bond fan, especially for those who have already seen the movie.This book is all about Bond.  Bond joins forces with Mathis, Vesper Lynd, and Felix Leiter on a mission to destroy Le Chiffre financially.  Le Chiffre is an agent of SMERSH and has lost their money.  Le Chiffre hopes to win it back.  This book defines Bond.  When Lynd gets too close, he cuts her off with a crude remark.  He savors his food because he often eats alone and has to do something to make it interesting. He as a sexist view of women, which should be expected of secret agents in the 1950s and should also be present in Bond of then and now. Yet over time, Bond finds himself getting close to Vesper, and this can be a dangerous thing for a secret agent.  The book is gritty and void of any giant action scenes.  It really isn't suspensful either, especially in the last third of the book.I recommend this easy to read book to all Bond fans.  However, it might seem tedious to those who are not totally immersed in the Bond franchise.
