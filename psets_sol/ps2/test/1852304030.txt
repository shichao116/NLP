I've been studying Chi Kung on my own now for almost 20 years, mostly through books, and as you can imagine I've read quite a few. Though most are quite good I consider THIS one the best out there, especially for someone looking for good general info on this fascinating topic. Beginning students will find a treasure trove of useful exercises, though more advanced practitioners may find some useful tidbits here too.What makes this book so great is that the exercises are extremely effective and quite simple to practice, and what is more, you don't have to practice them for years to get results. In fact I tried a few myself and noticed a considerable difference in only a few days. Some might find these exercises TOO simple and believe that they just CAN'T be that effective. This is a grave error that illustrates how people often assume that unless something is complicated it isn't worth practicing. Believe me, sometimes the most effective things are the most simple, and once you've practiced some of the exercises in this book you'll understand why.
