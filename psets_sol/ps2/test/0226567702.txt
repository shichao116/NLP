This scholarly comparison of Britain's source of success in the Malayan insurgency and America's source of failure in Vietnam is justifiably regarded as a textbook for a new military facing new worldwide challenges.  Much of the book is given over to index and reference and the writing style is complex, consisting of sometimes confusing compound sentences.  However, the lessons to be learned and the shocking revelations of the inability of the U.S. Army's leadership to adjust to the realities and challenges of guerrilla warfare in Vietnam make for some chilling reading.  Strongly recommended to students of modern military history and tactics
