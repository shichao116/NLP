I am very happy that I purchased this book. It is essentially transcripts from a series of classes that Ram Dass taught at Naropa Institute with appropriate changes made for a book format.As mentioned in the book, the material presented can be approached many different ways. I am taking it slow with the book and have used certain teachings and instructions to study on my own and go back to the book when I have completed this "independent study".. So it is as if I am taking my own course and not just ready a book of lectures.Instead of being a book about the Gita, you really are presented the means by which the Gita will come alive for you..Ram Dass presents some wonderful tools here and there is suffcient Grace to transform anyone's life..Really cool vintage photos too ! :-
