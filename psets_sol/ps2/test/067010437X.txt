my teacher recently assigned a book talk.it had to be a historical fiction book.that day, i went down to our school library and took out a book that looked good. i started to read it but fell asleep. that happened to me each time i tried. i went back to the library and there were hardly any historical fiction books left so i took "ADAM OF THE ROAD" out. when i showed all my freinds the cover they laughed. i thought it was funny too. i started to read it and it was amazing! i couldnt believe it. after you finish one chapter you just have to read the next. i highly recommend this book. dont judge a book by it's cover
