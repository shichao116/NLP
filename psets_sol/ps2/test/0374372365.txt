Loved the book!  The imagery is incredible and the text is captivating.  My kids joined in the refrain STE-E-E-E-EAMBOAT A'Comin after its first appearance, and kept repeating it long after we put the book down.  They loved the dog, too.  My husband, who is not big on picture books, read through it once quickly, then picked it up again after the kids were in bed so he could take his time enjoying it. I believe our deck is destined to become a steamboat this summer
