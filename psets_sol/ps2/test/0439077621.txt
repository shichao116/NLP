I'm 12 years old, and I love to read. I can absolutely say that this is with out a doubt one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read alot of great books. I love the way the author would put the letters, and the diary entries in the book, that way it let us see what the Queen, and Sarah  were going through. If you like historical books this is definatly on I  would read
