This book arrived at my doorstep as one of Easton Press' " 100 greatest books ever written". After perusing the first few pages I was certain the accolade was a hoax yet continued out of sheer folly.Being an outdoor enthusiast, I was astonished how Thoreau carefully developed a method of sustaining oneself without the need for civilization. He covers everything from living frugally to divesting oneself of the need of Adam Smith's division of labour. Great for the outdoor survivalist!The simplicity of such a life is matched only by the peace and inner reflection which arises by stripping away the unnecessary concerns which bombard us daily. The fact that his advice is still as applicable today as it was then is a testament to the author's insight.I particularly enjoyed his robust description of nature and her changing seasons. One gets a sense that Thoreau's hermetic life is only superficial and that a deeper intimate relationship exists with nature. He  becomes iconoclastic in his musings with nature questioning every aspect of the social norm. Man made laws vs natural laws are repeatedly contrasted hinting at the content of "civil disobedience".The single greatest lesson learned is the need to follow one's own thoughts and "conscience".
