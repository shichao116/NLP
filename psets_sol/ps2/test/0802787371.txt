I.P.T.U yoga and brain food I ask myself does all this have to happen just because of a test? This so called I.P.T.U test does not even go onto your report card after you take the test it has nothing to do with your life anymore.Before all this comotoin the principal Mr .wiggins losses his wig over perfect sharpen number two pencils. The I.P.T.U is not refered as the I.P.T.U anymore we now call it THE TEST.This school is going crazy and even the lunch lady Ms.Slopdown is serving fish,and other brain food in the cafeteria  and in P.E Mr.Fitenough is teaching yoga well at least we know that they are relaxed. Talk about the perfect circle in art the children are laerning how to bubble in a cirlce. After all of the flips and flops the school was the number 1 I.P.T.U champs
