As a high-school teacher I am finding this book an invaluable read. The combination of insights from educational psychology and practical examples of instructional design make this an essential read for all those who want to make their teaching more effective and who are dismayed by the many examples of poorly conceived e-learning that can be encountered on the web. I think this book is worth twice the price and deserves a very wide readership. It certainly amply rewards thoughtful and careful study
