The previous comments on this book are basically accurate. The reader is correct that it does not go into detail regarding the small circulation, but that's cause it wasn't meant to. Dr.Yang mentioned in the beginning that you should have already read and accomplished some part of the Yi Gin  Ching before going on to this volume. Also he mentions that you should have  READ and UNDERSTOOD what was written in his previous books, "The Root of Chinese Chi-Gung" and "Chi-Gung, Health and the Martial Arts". The Health and the Martial Arts book is where the Small and  Grand circulation is mentioned and taught in much greater detail.I have  been into REAL Gung-FU, Wu-Su for twenty-two serious years now and for fifteen years when I first wrote this review. I know that  what Dr.Yang is talking about is correct because I was taught, or heard my  instructors talking about the same things as Dr.Yang for years before I  read his books. I was taught by a student of a Gung-Fu Master that grew up  in one of the last Shaolin Temples that was destroyed in 1927. He is now over one hundred years old and looks like he's about thirty, with a strong solid physique, so you can be sure that he knows that Marrow washing Chi-gung as well.Dr. Yang states repeatedly in his books that you must make sure that you read and understand all the theory and comprehend it BEFORE you go on to the next level of material. Train smart and slow, NOT stupid and fast as Dr. Yang repeatedly states in his books. Just cause you may not understand something, don't assume that it's  the authors fault. I'm not saying that it's all perfect, some things could  be a little clearer. But being into physics myself since I was about 6  years old, and that fact that Dr.Yang also has a degree in Mechanical  engineering, has greatly helped him in his ability to break down and  explain the material from both a spiritual and physical point of view and from both the eastern and western view as well.Overall he has done and excellent job in his material and I personally owe him many thanks. The knowledge has helped me to grow and learn even more and faster than I was  before and attain new levels of health, fitness, youthfulness, energy and more. It also helps me when teaching my students as well. You don't have to be into physics though to understand the material. It is difficult to  understand no matter how you look at it. Even with my experience, I took  Dr.Yangs advice and read each book about thirty times, some sections more  than that BEFORE I started doing anything in the books, that is what you  must do to, especially if you are a newcomer to the field.Read  "The Root of Chinese Chi-Gung" first. Read it over and over if  you have to, then go on to  the "Eight Pieces of Brocade" then to  "Chi-Gung-Health and The Martial Arts" then, after at least two  years, if you understand and have done those things seriously and accomplished at least the small circulation,  I would say  that you could begin some of the material in The Marrow washing volume.  Follow the same pattern of reading it many times over and UNDERSTANDING the  material well BEFORE you practice what is written in there. Also, FOLLOW  the rules for Chi-Gung practice that are written therin and DO NOT take them lightly. I am speaking from experience here, you CAN mess yourself up and your health if you do not follow the rules that are given to you by  Dr.Yang. This is especially important for MEN who are generating and converting semen from the testicles. Don't waste that chi through excess sexual activity, stress, getting mad, run down or such. Women must also make sure that they limit chi loss at that time of the month as well as follow the same rules regarding stress both emotional and physical too. Fortunately I know some other healing techniques that I was able to fix what had been done to me and replace the lost chi, which was my own fault, no one else's.The techniques are safe and glorious, as long as you don't rush or take the  information and warnings lightly. Do it right and you won't believe the  results that you will get. Email me at Richsifu at gmail dot com for more info or questions. Just like driving a car is safe when you follow the rules of the road, you should be able to go for a lifetime without any accidents or problems. Take care, all the best to you in you Chi-Gung journey
