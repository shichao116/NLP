"In an instant, the jaws of a Mako shark can latch onto the calf of one whose back is turned. Rows of razor-sharp teeth puncture oil pants, boots, skin, and flesh, and sink into solid bone like nails into balsa wood." This is just one of the dangers faced by the fishermen on the Hannah Boden.Real life thrills and danger. Not the narcissitic thrill seeker, who bungie jumps or the mountain climber who ascends Mt. Hood knowing a storm is coming, yet tries to beat the squalls to the summit. This is the real life story of Linda Greenlaw, Captain of the Hannah Boden, the 100 ft. swordfishing boat. The story unfolds with the preparation and expectation of returning from a month at sea with 70,000 lbs of fish. All the while trying to maintain a mutually respectfull relationship with her crew and their no where near minor idosyncracies while at sea. Bob Brown, the crusty, pushy owner of the boat goads Ms. Greenlaw into making demands on herself and crew that are akin to miraculous.Nine to five does not exist. When the lines are cast the crew is punched in for 24 hour days adding up to approximately 700 hours. No benefits, no sick days, no salary. 700 hours of physical labor, in poor conditions, that you might not get paid for. No fish, no pay.20,000 gallons of fuel, 280 miles of open sea before the fishing even begins, sickness, competition, engine trouble and danger all managed with finesse, firmness, nerves of steel, stamina most men can't comprehend, and motherly love. Linda Greenlaw tells a story you can't put down, from her heart, in a down to earth fashion, making even a land lubber long for the high seas and salty air.
