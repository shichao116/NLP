If I could recommend only one book for every aspiring entrepreneur to read, it would be The One Minute Millionaire, by Mark Victor Hansen and Robert G. Allen. I have personally read OMM four times and refer back to it often for its valuable tips. It's a perfect blend of Mark Victor Hansen's inspiring self-improvement advice and Robert G. Allen's unique and practical money-making techniques.From the moment you pick up OMM, you'll realize that this book is unlike any other wealth-building title you've ever read. One the left-hand pages, you'll follow the heart-pounding story of Michelle, a woman with a need greater than most of us know. In the story, Michelle has only 90 days to make one million dollars...or she'll never see her kids again. Will she make it? How will she do it? You'll see her every move. On the right-hand pages, Mark and Robert explain in a simple, practical way the wealth building principles and techniques as they are embedded in Michelle's story. Mark and Robert present their profound wealth-building knowledge through dozens of practical examples, realistic scenarios, inspiring quotes, and interactive diagrams that will make you feel like this book is glued to your hands.Have you ever had an "aha!" moment? In OMM, you'll learn the 24 Millionaire "Aha's" (eye-opening principles that change the way you think), along with 17 powerful manifestations. The One Minute Millionaire is about the concept of becoming an enlightened millionaire; a person who builds incredible wealth by contributing to others and making the world a better place to live. The authors teach that by making simple, one-minute changes, anyone can develop the mindset and create the habits of a person who magnetically attracts abundance.I can confidently say that when you glide over the ending words of the last page, you'll experience mixed feelings. Secretly, you'll wish it wasn't over. But you'll put it down feeling transformed, refreshed, and ready to take on the world
