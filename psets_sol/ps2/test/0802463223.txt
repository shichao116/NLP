This book really opened my eyes.  It is not a feel good book.  It drove home the fact that I will have to account for my life someday.  The discussions on hell and hades were for me very scary.  It was what I needed to hear.  It has made me much more concious of how I live my life.  I believe this book will help many take their christian life much more seriously.  I would highly recommend it
