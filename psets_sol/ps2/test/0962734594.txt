I have cooked Indian food for about 10 years now using recipes from an Indian cooking class my mother took, but this book has given me a much better understanding of how Indian meals come together, techniques in making different types of dishes and the Indian names for the recipes and many of the ingredients, which makes them easier to shop for at the Indian grocery I go to.Directions are clear and comprehensive, and written in a very easy, conversational style. Most ingredients have been easy to find at the regular grocery, but I prefer going to the Indian market for quality and better prices, especially on the many spices used in great quantity.The recipes are absolutely DELICIOUS! Everything is extremely tasty, healthful and filling.  I feel so much better eating this food than almost any other.  I've tried recipes from pretty much every section of the book, and some have become permanent features in my regular repertoire.  You MUST buy this book!
