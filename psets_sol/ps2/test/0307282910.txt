I still don't understand how a work of fiction written in another language can have such power even after translated, but somehow Funke brings another world to life and within that world, another world that is terrifying and beautiful and . . . strangely original.In this sequel to Inkheart, everything I wished would happen, did, and everything I was dreading might happen, did as well.It was moving, beautiful, horrifying and above all, very, very real.Farid, Dustfinger, Mo and Meggie seem to be living people who could very easily walk out of this book and have a conversation with you, and clue you in as to how difficult it is to be a character in a book you can't control.Fascinating book. I cannot wait for the third
