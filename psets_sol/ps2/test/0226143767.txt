In Staging Tourism: Bodies On Display From Waikiki To Sea World, author Jane Desmond argues that the public display of bodies (how they look, what they do, where they do it, who watches, and under what conditions) is  profoundly important in structuring identity categories of race, gender,  and cultural affiliation. These displays and showcased activities form the  basis of a hugely profitable tourist industry, which in turn forms crucial  arenas of public culture where embodied notions of identity are sold,  enacted, and debated. Desmond draws from written accounts, postcards,  photographs, advertisements, films, and oral histories to make her own  interpretations of these displays. She give a vibrant account of American  tourism in Waikiki from 1900 to the present, juxtaposes cultural tourism  with &quot;animal tourism&quot; (zoos, aquariums, animal theme parks), and  argues the relationship between the viewer and the viewed as ultimately  based on concepts of physical difference harking back to the 19th Century.  Staging Tourism is an informative, riveting, tour-de-force presentation of  the tourist industry within its wider social contexts and ideological  frameworks in order to delineate the contemporary tourist experience.  Staging Tourism is recommended reading for students of American popular  culture, the economics of recreation, and the history of tourism in the  United States
