Teaching children about recent historical atrocities is always difficult. It's hard for them to believe that human beings can treat others brutally.  It's an element of grace that children find it hard to believe the events we know to be true about the Holocaust and more recently, Darfur, can occur.Imagine what it would be like for a nazi commander's naive nine year old son to realize his father was part of his best friend's nightmare, and you'll get some idea of the power of this book.It is told thru the voice of a nine year old boy as he witnesses events he never fully comprehends.  Does the barbed wire around "Out With", his way of pronouncing Auschwitz, keep his family from playing with those inside?  Why can't he go in?  Why are there so many children inside and none outside where he lives?Bruno, this nine year old boy, also calls the Fuhrer, the Fury.  Appropriately,  but of course not intentionally.  It's the way he speaks.I think most people who have read extensively about the Holocaust would relish a book that gives some insight into how a nazi's children would have felt about what went on, had they had any knowledge about the camps.  I know that for years I wondered why there aren't books filled with interviews of such children, explaining how they've assimilated their parent's behaviour into their own personal histories.This book is well done.  I highly recommend it
