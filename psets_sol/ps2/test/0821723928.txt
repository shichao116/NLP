I found ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN, the autobiography of Michael Reagan (son of actress Jane Wyman and former U.S. president Ronald Reagan), hard to put down.  I finished reading it in just a few days and wished the presidency of the author's father had come and gone as quickly.Michael Reagan's dead honesty regarding his personal tragedies will compel you to keep turning the pages of ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN.  One would think being the son of a famous movie actress and, later in life, having your father elected governor of California and then president of the United States guarantees life on Easy Street.  But as Michael Reagan discloses, no matter how good something like that looks, the reality can differ so greatly that you will ask yourself, "Why me?"The only ON THE OUTSIDE . . . passages with scissor marks pertain to Ronald and Nancy Reagan.  For instance, Michael Reagan mentions an incident where it was "the only time I saw my father and Nancy argue" but discloses no details.  At least Michael Reagan admits showing his father and Mrs. Reagan a pre-publication draft of the book, even if he does not flat-out say he cut any text to please them.But ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN merits five stars nonetheless.   Michael Reagan shows a ton of courage telling his story.  I hope I can shake his hand some day
