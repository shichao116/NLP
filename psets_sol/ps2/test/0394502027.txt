Author James A. Michener has conceived and written an epic novel about the land we now know as the Chesapeake Bay region.  Using his characteristic writing style of starting at the very beginning (in this case, with the Native American Indians) and then developing the story generation after generation through his rich and interesting characters, Michener tells the complete story of the Chesapeake region. The reader learns how the white settlers from Europe displaced the natives, what animals roamed its lands or flew its skies (he has a whole chapter on Canadian Honker geese - fascinating reading by the way!), what the settlers faced when they tried to build homes and put down roots, how the American shipbuilding industry came to this region, the fight for emancipation of the negro in the Civil War, the great migration of geese and the hunters that tried to shoot them for food and sport, and so much more.Like other Michener novels, as I was reading "Chesapeake" I thoroughly became engrossed in the story to the extent that I forsook sleeptime to enjoy hours of late-night reading.  I literally could not put the book down!Yes, the novel is long - over 1,000 pages, but it is still an absorbing page-turner. Each chapter is a mini-novel in itself and tells the story of a particular generation of people in the Chesapeake Bay development. Michener has a knack of creating and developing characters that are both interesting and believable and this is his greatest strength as a writer. The reader comes to care about these fictious charcters as though they are living breathing realities, and in a sense, the characters are "real", as Michener's painstaking research enabled him to create his charcters based on historical personages."Chesapeake" is a marvelous book in a long series of marvelous Michener books.  For those that love sweeping epic novels, this is a book for you. It seems that Michener's writing style either fascinates or tries the patience of his readers. Michener goes into great detail in explaining the lives of his characters and some readers are impatient with his extensive prose and are apt to put his books down before finishing them. I happen to love his writing style and appreciate the detail, as it paints vivid word pictures in my mind that I never forget. Michener is one of my favorite authors, for each of his books takes me to a particular place or culture, and it is as though I am actually viewing that culture, its people, and the land first-hand. I have learned a wealth of information about near and distant lands thanks to the writing of James A. Michener. These are places I may never have the opportunity to visit in my life, but thanks to Michener, it is as though I have been there through his writing.I most certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the land and people of the Chesapeake Bay region, or to one who is a student of American history. The book is also a good read for the story alone, irrespective of the history lesson one learns coincidentally.  Once you read "Chesapeake", you will have a greater appreciation for the great struggles that our forefathers and foremothers went through to bring western "civilization" to this great land. I guarantee you will always remember "Chesapeake" and its characters for the rest of your life.I highly recommend this book!Jim "Konedog" Koenig
