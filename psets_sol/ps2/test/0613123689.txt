I read Beauty first then this book. I absolutely loved it. I would recommend it to people of all ages. I also recently read The Wand in the Word--a book that contains interviews with various fantasy writers. Ms. McKinley isn't featured in there but one of the authors was inspired by Beauty. So I thought I'd buy it. Now I'm hooked on Robin McKinley.I hope you read her books too
