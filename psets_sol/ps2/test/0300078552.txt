What a wonderful book!  It helps one to explore the identity of a good teacher - a truly valuable focus for professional development in any type of school.  The authors explore the characteristics of a &quot;good teacher&quot; including ethics, patience, love of learning, and - imagine! - pleasure!  That is, one should only be a teacher if one enjoys teaching!  Wish a few of my teachers had considered that notion.  If you are a &quot;born teacher,&quot;  this book will affirm you and remind you of why you do it
