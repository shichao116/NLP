I bought this book to give to a young man who is developing an interest in market investing. Here is the reason: When I first began to study the stock market years ago, I found the books I bought so frustrating I nearly quit! I couldn't even understand the terminology and complained, Why don't they write in ENGLISH?! It was terrible! I didn't know about William O'Neil's books at the time. This book will give the reader a sound basis in the stock market and at least the beginning of a trading plan (I think everyone develops their own through experience). I give this book the ultimate five stars for the novice newcomer, or even for the person who has been investing unsuccessfully and wants to change that! A very worthwhile book! Arlea
