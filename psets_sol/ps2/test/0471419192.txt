i read this book about 4 years ago, and it changed the way i think and analyze everything. it's by far the most important book i have ever read in my entire life. after reading it, i contacted howard blooom because i was so affected. i even went to his apartment in brooklyn one night to chat with him. he is a true genius.even if you aren't interested in evolution, this book offers so much insight into humans, and systems in general. there is nothing in this book you can argue with. in fact, when i tell people about it, i point out that ONE THIRD of the book is the bibliography - this guy knows his stuff. anyway, this book should not only be read but enthusiastically recommended to every person who is interested in understanding life and reality in general
