I came late to the Anne Heche party.  I loved her in Volcano (a schlocky movie) and only recently saw her in Six Days, Seven Nights which I surprisingly liked.  I have the hard-cover version of the book which has a different cover, and puts her in a more flattering light.Trained as a mental health professional, I must say I found the book well written from the perspective of a person recovering from the appalling abuse Anne suffered.  She is very candid and frank about the type of abuse she remembers.  Things get a lot more murky once she's famous and she basically glosses over Anne-n-Ellen.  That's too bad as that's why I bought the book at the bargain bin the bookstore.I must say she did a lot of kooky, goofy, potentially dangerous and desperate things.  I think she missed a lot of major points about her relationship with Ellen and how it related to her relationship to her mother, who is atrocious.  However, I will never look at Anne Heche the same way again, and I will always have empathy and support to give to her for her struggle which I'm sure is continuing up until this very day
