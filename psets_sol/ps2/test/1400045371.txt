I just finished the Landmark Educational Forum which had a huge impact on me.  "Loving what is" came to be at the right time following that as it repeats some of the lessons except a bit differently.  It has given me so much comfort and joy.  Knowing that i don't have to fix anything and to stay in my business has been a burden lifted off my shoulders.  Today i will order Katie's latest book "A thousand names for Joy".  I loved the CDs but this time i want to take my time and read it.  My relationships have changed dramatically especially with my children.  I thought i was being a perfect parent when in reality i was a big pain in their behind.  Also, my anxiety level has decreased tremendously.  Yes, I still have bad days but i'm able to work through things quicker.  I may stew for 30 minutes now rather than days.  I'd definitely recommend it
