On 45th Street in Manhattan there is a restaurant that is favored by theatre folk and playgoers alike, Joe Alllen's is it's name and on their walls are theatrical posters, not unusual for the locale, being in the heart of the theatre district, what's notable about the collection of posters is that all those displayed were huge flops. Steven Suskin's, "Second Act Trouble" takes this concept (theatrical failures) and illuminates how once promising shows turn into failures. The collection covers twenty or so Broadway shows(some never made it to The Great White Way) that flopped, losing all or most of their investment. The articles, published previously from bios and newspaper accounts from various writers, are grouped into chapters such as; When Everything Goes Wrong, Star Turns and Battle Stations. Suskin has assembled the most illuminating accounts of; what seemed like a good idea at the time, Liza Minneli directed by Martin Scorcesse-can't fail, right?  It is a very enjoyable read although as you follow show after show dive off a cliff it gets a little depressing, how they failed; the who, what and where of" bombs" could be instructive for investors and producers alike, but, alas there is no sure fire formula for a hit show (could you imagine a show about a murderer who dices up his victims and makes pies out of them plus he's singing-Sweeny Todd). I am a theatre goer but even if you are not it's a fascinating peek into Broadway and what makes it tick...and sometimes it's ticking is the prelude to a very large bomb. Fun read
