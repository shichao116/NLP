This to me is without a doubt one of the most influental books of the past century. It exposes a misunderstood man who during the Civil Rights Movement played a vital role in voicing the opinion of Black America. It is sad to see that he still is often portrayed as a racist angry black man. That to the simple mind is the easy way to label him as, but it would not serve those who are really intent on understanding him as a person. He was a far smarter person who was caught in a time of tension between races and negative sterotypes from all people (Lets face it. If you grew up as a teenager or older during that time period, you would of had some extreme misconception or bias towards someone of a different race too. So to all these people who bash him for being anti-whitey, stop being so closed minded and place yourselves in the shoes of our ancestors.), and only grew as a person until his untimely assassination. Not only is it inspiring and filled with its own tradegies, it leaves a lot to be desired and offers the views of one of black america's most beloved heroes. I could write a essay on him here, but I would perfer for the reader to learn from him through his own readings. Read this book, but dont read it having already judged who he is or understanding the racial views of the times
