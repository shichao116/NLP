The key word in Villani's title is ART, and we've got plenty of it in Hot Springs. With over 27 non-profits directly related to the visual and performing arts, the author hits right on the money to concentrate on the Hot Springs Music Festival, held first two weeks of June every year; the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival in October, one of four preliminary sites for the Academy Awards; and 200 consecutive monthly Gallery Walks in Historic Downtown. Affordable? We think so. Refreshing? Absolutely. For more information, see www.nativecuriosity.blogspot.com
