If you think you've been bitten bad by the Apple bug, wait till you read about how far some people have gone to express their devotion to the Macintosh. Long-time Apple journalist Kahney has compiled and expanded his Wired News blogs into a thoroughly entertaining full-color 268-page hardcover. The uninitiated may mock the gusto with which geeks profess their love for a box of bits, while "the rest of us" can justify our extreme devotion to the Mac with a knowing wink of self-recognition and the relief that at least we're not as bad as those with Apple logo tattoos, warehouses full of old hardware, Classics converted into bongs, or the obsession of videotaping every Macworld Expo keynote.In the interest of full disclosure, you should know that I am the author of Apple Confidential 2.0, another Mac-centric book from the same publisher, No Starch Press
