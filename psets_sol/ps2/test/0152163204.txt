Being Dead by Vivian Vande Velde is a book that left me quite unsure of what to expect when I picked it up the other day.  It had a couple of interesting reviews on the front and back stating how scary the stories were and claiming that they would keep you restless for several nights at a time.  After reading the first story, Drop by Drop, I was blown away at how amazingly unexpected the ending was and how likeable Brenda (the main character) was.  The story itself is about a girl (Brenda) moving into an old house in Upstate, New York and discovering that the little girl who haunts her isn't all she's cracked up to be.  The other stories in the book were amazing, too, but I felt that none of them really were comparable to Drop by Drop.I reccomend this book to readers of all ages, preferably those who, like me, were in dire need of a spooky tale to tell their friends at an upcoming sleepover.  Enjoy
