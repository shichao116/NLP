The book was very interesting (especailly since I am currently studying criminal justice and forensic science).  I found the short stories to be very convenient in allowing me to pick up the book and put it down again with my busy schedule.  However, I must admit the numerous spelling errors did get on my nerves.  Overall the content was good and I would say the book was worth the read
