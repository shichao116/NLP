Bensen offers a wonderful guide to the Pony Express enthusiast.   Paralleling the original trail and stations, the Guide gives an  east-to-west account for finding the (Pony and non-Pony) sites, museums,  and curiosities along the historical trail.  Bensen has been particularly  thorough in reporting where sites of interest are on private property.  I  found this book to have many helpful features including an accurate  assessment of whether or not an obscure site was worth getting to, what  types of vehicles--from all-terrain to RV's--are appropriate for particular  stretches of the route, alternate routes for those pressed for time, and  great Pony By-ways.  This guide also includes interesting historical  anecdotes inserted at appropriate intervals to the surrounding text.   Highly recommended for anyone wanting to follow the trail of the Pony  Express
