Jeanne Martinet's book the &quot;Art of Mingling&quot; would have better been titled &quot;An Overview of How To Be the Party's Fool.&quot; Her advice often degrades both the mingler and the group they wish to enter.  Many of her tips actually separate the mingler from the rest of the party  goers. Her worries over how someone may interrupt her remarks are well  placed considering how snide and repulsive they are. Mrs. Martinet's  callousness is uncalled for in any social setting. 	What happened to  the strides the feminist movement has made? Mrs. Martinet's advice degrades  both the mingler and the group she wishes to enter. The &quot;Helpless  Hanna&quot; routine smacks of a female incapable of taking care of herself.  The theory of pretending to be someone else, &quot;star,&quot; achieves the  same outcome. If everyone at a party choose to be someone they are not the  purpose of minglingwould be lost. Her opening gambits concerning clothes  and &quot;a room with a view&quot; is base and a turnoff. Most groups would  see through the ploys and soon the mingler will be known as false. 	The  definition of mingling, as given by the author, is to join with others.  However, many of the tips keep the party mingler from joining with the  group. There is never a nerd at a party. Everyone is there for a reason,  and the mingler may find that they have much to contribute to the party.  The same is true for the &quot;Changing of the guard&quot; exit routine.  The &quot;dot, dot, dot&quot; trick is degrading to the speaker and all  other's in the group because they know that the mingler is not paying  attention. In her smooth escape the mingler comes off as rude and  superficial. The advice to be constantly moving from group to group may  appear to other's that the mingler is the center of the action, but they  lose the meaning of mingling. Even constantly scanning the room removes the  mingler from the group from the beginning. 	Throughout the book Mrs.  Martinet is concerned with how others will see her. If the antidote of her  mother telling the author everyone in the room is more concerned with  themselves is true, the author may wish to apply it. The audacity of  playing with another language, speaking style, or an accent is risky at  best. What would be the consequences of saying something in Spanish or  German and receiving an answer? The use of accents and speaking style  especially a regional one is offensive. Even her advice to use &quot;little  white lies&quot; to make yourself better is snide. She may be surprised  that in the real world most people consider the little lie repulsive and a  turnoff to the present company. It may surprise the author how fast the  warning that there is a liar in at the party gets around the room. 	It  is not wise for any new mingler to follow any of the advice Mrs. Martinet  offers. Try to be oneself and relax. Any gracious person will realizes that  help is needed and most will come to the nervous person. The parties that  Mrs. Martinet attends are not the norm. Hopefully, one day she will come  down off the horse and write a decent book. She has a wonderful writing  style
