To live the life of Walter Cronkite is to live a thousand years.  For nearly half a decade Walter Cronkite served as the voice of reason to millions of Americans who looked to his print, radio, and television reports for information and reassurance.  This autobiography covers the life of Walter Cronkite from his early life as a lowly radio announcer to his ultimate stand at the pinnacle of journalism.As usual, Cronkite's wit is second-to-none and comes through clearly in his prose.  Still, he never pulls punches and minces no words regarding the multitude of famous and powerful men and women he met along the way.  His engrained honesty and objectivity is a refreshing look to when journalism was an honest art, plagued not by corporate sponsorship.Cronkite's work not only serves as an interesting look at "Cronkite, the man," but is a work of modern American history, written by the man who lived and reported it all.  For a readable, enjoyable look at Cronkite's America, "A Reporter's Life" is one of the best.
