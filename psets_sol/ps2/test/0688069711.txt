Electric current, nerves, and dedifferentiated cells form blastama that will different into tissue, bones, and organs.  Becker discovered negative charged electric current after limb injury.  He observed tissue repair for CNS, Brain, Bone, and heart in Salamander specimens.   The heart of regenerative technology is the ability too create artifical dedifferentiation.  Current causes the puromycin blockage to be lifted.   The cells differentiate into new tissue and bone structures in the damaged area.  The electric forces unlock the repressed genes.  Mammals followed a similar pattern, Blastemas form around electrodes flowing with low current and redifferentiation proceed into tissue regeneration.  Becker used Rats too test out the idea.  The rat had regrown a shft of bone extending from the severed humerous, new muscle, and new nerve.  At least ten different kinds of cells had differentiated out from the blastema.  The regeneration was not complete but offered promising potential for complete regeneration in the future.By mid-1978 Becker had successfully treated fourteen osteomyelitis patients with positive silver mesh wire.  Five of them had healed nonunions.  The silver mesh wire had stimulated bone-forming cells, cured stubborn infections from all kinds of bacteria, and stimulated healing in skin and other soft tissues.Cartiage damage from arthritis.  Becker reasoned that since cartiage was made from one kind of cells they could get it to regenerate.  A orthopedic surgeon removed the cartilage layer from one side fo the femar at the knee of a white rabbit.  They then implanted silver-platinum couplings into the bone and extending to the region where the cartilage was removed.  All rabbit great improved repair.  However, two of the rabbits completely healed with hyaline cartilage just like the original material.The Lazus heart involved the surgical removal of the scar tissue, placing an electrod at the damage site, injecting embroyonic stem cells and sealing the region with a tissue patch.  Beck seemed hopeful that one day the procedure would be used to heal massive heart damage.Spinal cord injury involved debridement of the cord ends, injecting cutured embryonal ependymal cells, and a ectrode to DC generator, close the wound an allow regenerating between the cord ends
