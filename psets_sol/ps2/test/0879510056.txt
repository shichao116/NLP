If you have ever wished for one book to neatly package absurdist theatre, Mr. Esslin's book is the one.  This book is readable, comprehendable, entertaining and engaging.  In fact, it's rather difficult to put down.  His introduction does wonders to dispel any myths as to what absurdist theatre is and isn't.  He follows the introduction by individually highlighting those playwrights often associated with the absurd (Beckett, Adamov, Ionesco, Genet, and Pinter).  Of interest is the fact that he does not overwhelm or bore the reader by providing an excess of information.  On the contrary, each section is unbelievably tight.  His section on Adamov is much appreciated, considering that finding anything on him is near impossible. He then continues with his &quot;Parallels and Proselytes&quot; in which he touches on &quot;lesser-known&quot; playwrights (Albee, Arrabal, and others).  He follows this section with three more equally fascinating chapters.  In short, Mr. Esslin packs a breadth of relevant information into 480 pages.  &quot;The Theatre of the Absurd&quot; should find a welcome home on the bookshelves of actors, directors, dramaturgs, playwrights, or those with an interest in theatre.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed
