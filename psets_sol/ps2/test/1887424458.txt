Anybody who is interested in Sci-Fi or Fantasy artwork should be a big fan of this series.  Spectrum 1 is actually a reprint of the original.  The reason that I won't give it 5 stars is that since this was the first, it's format is that of a directory of illustrators.  For an even better experience, pick up books 9-11, they're worth the cost.Pand
