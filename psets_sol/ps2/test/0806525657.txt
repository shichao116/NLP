There's lots more in this book than just drink recipes--great info on setting up a home bar, funny funny stories, etc. I especially liked the author's personal touch--like the stories about her or her coworkers at the Blue Whale Strip Club and learning that there's more to drink out there than just "cheap liquor" or beer. Good bar food recipes, too.  I'm already making out my list for who get's this one for Christmas.  Basically everyone who I know that drinks.  Talk about your easy Holiday shopping
