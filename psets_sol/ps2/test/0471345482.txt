Did not intend to read the whole book when picked it up but ended up reading every word.  An excellent approach and delivery of 'how to' develop and implement a business plan.  Presented in a manner that was very  enjoyable, easy to follow and to invision the entire picture of business  management from planning to implementation.  This book provides step by  step information for a manager of any type business to develop a good  business plan that will ensure success.  I highly recommend this book.   &quot;Read and Enjoy&quot;, It is not everyday that this kind of  information is offered
