It seems that the quality of the pictures is almost secondary to the collection themselves - an arrangement of America's best delegates of expresssion.  As the market place of American music seems to fall further  and further away from the proliferation of substance and artistic value,  Frielander's &quot;American's . . . &quot; serves as a shouting out for the  need of education of the youth to the lives of these real American heroes.   When asked of his taste or distaste for record sampling as a modern  recording technique, Ray Charles expressed his fears that the sources of  the sound bytes used may go unexplored thus squandering any hope of  education.  Prophetic? Perhaps.  Frielander has assembled a striking visual  dictionary that could be instructive in opening another dimension to musics  that have gone undiscovered by the youth of today as well as remindind  parents that the fire in music, captured here, transcends generations and  may be a point of departure for cross-generational, cross-sexual,  cross-racial summits to be convened
