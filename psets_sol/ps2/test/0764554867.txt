Laura Schellhardt, author of the book, spells it all out.  I am always daunted when I set out to write a screenplay, but this book allowed me to break down that process into managable tasks.  This book covers it all from the pre-writing phases of research, character development, outlines and plot structure to the writing phase of screenplay format, scene development and overall layout and ends with suggestions on how to further develop and revise your work when it is finished and eventually sell it.  I recommend this book to anyone, as it covers topics that will make any screenwriter's work (whether beginner or pro) fuller and richer and the process all the more simpler
