This is, sadly to say, the last book that Kenneth Millar wrote before his eventually fatal illness.  It is also, perhaps, the best.  I say perhaps because his last fifteen or so books are so good that there is really no way to make any significant distinctions between them.Like all Lew Archer books, this one features a large number of characters,many of whom are related to or have been involved with each other in in the past that they all wish was dead, but never is.  This book, too begins with a small investigation, finding a missing person, but Archer always seems to be the pebble that starts the avalanche.  The plot complicates, the pace quickens, the end comes like a Greek tragedy.The plotting and suspence are wonderful, the setting is beautifully rendered, and the style is perfect.  My wife is blind, and i have read many books to her. Macdonald and Tolkien are the best stylists we have run into.I have read all of Macdonald's books at least twice and some of them several times.  Like all the best books, even when you know how they turn out you still can't put them down.Raymond Chandler is the great model for Macdonald, and, along with Doyle and Sayers, are my favorite mystery writers.  Macdonald is better.  I would rank him with Faulkner and Hemingway as one of the best American novelists of the Twentieth Century.  I know there is a Library of America volume of Chandler.  I hope soon we will have Macdonald as well.  He deserves it.Goodbye, Lew.  It was an honor to know you
