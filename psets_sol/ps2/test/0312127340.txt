I highly recommend this book to all of my lesson students.  I strongly feel that it helps the to progress more smoothly, and also have less "plateaus".  I feel that any rider regardless of their chosen discipline should read this book.  It really explains the principles behind riding correctly.  This was a book that I was required to purchase and read at the equestrian university I attended.  Again I highly recommend this book.  It is easy to read and easy to understand. Plus it has very good illustrations to clarify points.  I hope this review is helpful.  www.horselogic.ne
