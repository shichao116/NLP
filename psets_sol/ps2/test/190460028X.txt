This book is very well organized.  I am very pleased with it.  By playing several of the openings in the book I have found myself (finally) able to defeat the computer at chess at levels where I couldn't do so before.  I have also learned which openings are to be avoided as well, that way I don't have to spend time memorizing all of them.  But it is still important to understand why some openings aren't good
