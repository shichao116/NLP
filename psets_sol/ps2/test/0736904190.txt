We have bought this book for many people.  It helped us quite a bit in our Christian walk.  Our enemy doesn't want us to know the truth.  Bob George does an excellent job in helping one to see clearly the results of being saved from our sins.  He gives great examples and writes in a way that "common folk" can read and understand easily.
