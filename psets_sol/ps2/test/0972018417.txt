I have been reading over the reviews and have to admit the frustration I feel from those that give this book a bad review.First, Bill Phillips wants everyone to succeed and his workout plans and eating plans do work!  But you must follow exactly or you will get different results!  How can anyone second guess the thousands of breathtaking transformations that he is responsible for?He stresses simplicity in the body-for-life book.  Nothing needs to be harder or made harder than it is.  This is how people get themselves into trouble and not see the dramatic fat loss results. And this book is no exception.If it weren't for this book, I would not be as excited as I am in doing this program and taking time out to eat.  Note: it is not a "diet."  Nutritional information may be importrant to some, but I believe most people care about quick, simple, and not boring.If you are concerned about if you are eating enough or not enough, there is one easy thing you can do provided you are doing the BFL program to the letter.Six balanced meals/day= eating close to every 2 1/2 - 3 hrs.  If you notice that you are getting hungry after only  an hour and a half - two hours, eat just a bit more of your protein and carbs.  If you are not hungry at hour 3 then lowere your intake just a bit.  It works. Once you find your proper portions, it is a snap!Nutritional information is not in the book because it is not needed for simplicity reasons.  You can go to the body-for-life.com to get this info.  This is what makes it a no brainer and easy for people to follow.In regards to those who don't like the idea of artificial sweeteners, fat free or processed foods etc..., then find another recipe or omit it.  Just because it is in the recipe doesn't mean you "have" to eat it.  I believe that this is for anyone (and most people)from getting bored with their meals from lack of taste.Vary these recipes if need be and enjoy them.  If we followed strict "can't have this or that", then no one would be as successful as the thousands of body for lifers out there.  This is what keeps me from the boredom of meals.  It is common sense and Bill would never put anything in a book that he didn't truly believe in.I believe in him and his years of experience.  He doesn't look the way he does for nothing.  Kudos Bill. My husband did this program a few years back and lost 35 lbs in 12 weeks using this exact book.  We have started the body-for-life and eating-for-life once again and LOVE it.Take all the negative reviews with a grain of salt.  This is a very good book.  Good luck to all.
