the title describes the style.  brautigan would cast his line in and pull out an interesting specimen;each time holding it in the sunlight for us to see it's glistening body.  each short chapter in this cunningly crafted book is like that.  brautigan's use of the english language was imaginative and pure.  his observations are refreshing,sometimes madcap,sometimes surprisingly poignant but always originating in left field. there is nobody quite like brautigan;an original in every way.  don't be fooled by those who would consign him to a specific era;for his work, especially this book,is timeless.
