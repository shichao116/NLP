I have difficulties with this parable about virginity.  As another reviewer pointed out the two sisters conform to the current culture stereotype of one outwardly beautiful, but inwardly plain and foolish and the other being outwardly plain but inwardly favored and wise.  The fair sister is constantly rewarded with attention and praise, which turns her head and causes her to de-value the apple of purity trusted into her care.  She neglects it, and shares it with those who wish to admire its beauty and perfection and is of course found unworthy.  The neglected, overlooked, plain sister; being responsible and favored by her parents, hides away her apple save to polish it, keeps it safe and by enhancing the perfection of her purity, is rewarded by marriage to the handsome "Prince".The flaw in the story is the same flaw I've seen in these parables since I was a young girl.  The girls' apples are NOT their own, and they are not keeping them for their benefit.  They are holding them in trust for the young man.  The gains for their perfect for condition is his, and how he chooses to reward them for it.  The male character is judge of the girls' worthiness, not themselves.  How does this enhance their self-worth and self-esteem?  Liza gets satisfaction of knowing that she was responsible and therefore earned the reward of marriage; and simply regards her sister as "having made her own choice", rather than seeing his love as conditional to the state of her 'apple' rather than the state of her heart, mind and soul.  IF the apple had been her own, and she choose to find him worthy to share it with, or decided that his test for a wife was contrived and shamed her sister needlessly and refused him, to keep her purity for her OWN, then I could have respect for it.As it is, this story still follows traditional party line, pretty girls get tempted and will probably give in.  Plain girls won't attract attention and are more likely to be responsible, and it is the man's opinion who holds the most weight.No, this book will not be given to my neices
