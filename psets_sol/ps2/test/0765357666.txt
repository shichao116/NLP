Hidden talents was a educational but thrilling book. The book spoke about friends sticking together and never judge anyone by what they look like or what they do.It also spoke about trusting each other no matter what.The story line was wonderfully done with skill and craftmanship.I gave this book four stars not five because of its lack of detail which made it seam shorter then it should have bean
