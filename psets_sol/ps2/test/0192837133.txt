This book, which has  decent plotline and some surprisingly twists and turns, ends up leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth after a while.  The main protagonist Adeline cries almost every page she is one(not an exaggeration, she really almost cries on EVERY page).  Also, though the coincidences and twists are sometimes very well-done and clever, they are so overused by the finale to become tedious and annoying.  You begin to wonder how anyone could marry anyone since EVERYONE in France seems to be someone's long lost cousin or uncle.  If you've read any of Edmund Burke's lengthly writings of the sublime, you will see it all over this book and it is about half of the endnotes.  It is understandable why this was popular in its day but also will not appeal to a modern audience who will be far more critical of the female's over the top self pity.  A great read for those who love the genre and a pain to read for everyone else, read Romance of the Forest only if you're willing to accept more instances of crying than there are pages in the whole book
