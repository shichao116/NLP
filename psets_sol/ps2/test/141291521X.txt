I never received this book.  Apparently it had been sold to someone else the same time I bought it - that's fine, however, I had to write numerous emails inquiring on the status of the book.  I couldn't get a clear answer for over a week.  This seller just needs to respond with correct information so the buyers are able to make adjustments to find the bookd elsewhere.  I ws on a time constraint because this book was for school.
