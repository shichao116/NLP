It is unfortunate that there is no good history of the Hmong published in any Western language.  Keith Quincy must be commended on his effort, but it is disappointing.  He is not a professional historian.  The first chapter  in particular, ostensibly dealing with the Hmong experience in China, shows  his unfamiliarity with Chinese history and inability to use Chinese  sources.  (The story of the &quot;Hmong&quot; king's defeat by China  actually concerns the conquest of the Jinchuan people, who were not Hmong.)   Quincy uncritically uses an unreliable account by F. Savina, _Histoire des  Miao_ (Hong Kong, 1924).  For a better study of Hmong in China see Robert  Jenks, _Insurgency and Social Disorder in Guizhou_ (University of Hawaii  Press, 1994).  The rest of the book is a little better, but must be read  with caution and cross-checked with other sources
