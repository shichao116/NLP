This collection features nearly four decades of the cartoonist's short fiction, culled from sources as diverse as Playboy magazine, the ground breaking Dangerous Visions anthology, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and Omni magazine. As stated in the publicity materials, "Sometimes amusing, sometimes frightening, Wilson's short fiction is as eclectic as his cartooning."  Like those cartoons, Wilson's stories are macabre, dark, and humorous, strange little forays into the weird and bizarre.  My personal favorite was Wilson's tribute to Sax Rohmer and Fu Manchu, "The Power of the Mandarin," an engaging examination of the tension between authors and their creations.
