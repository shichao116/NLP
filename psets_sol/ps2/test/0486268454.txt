This book has many beautiful stencil designs and is a good resource book for the professional stenciler. The designs are all copy right free. The only complaint I have is that some of the designs are printed very small and it can be quite difficult to enlarge it to the right size. Also some of the designs can be a little difficult for a beginner to cut themselves.This book is more suited for a professional or someone very experience in cutting their own stencils
