This is a great taoist alchemy treatise. The root text by Chang Po Tuan is presented along with enlightening commentaries. It has helped me understanding the "Secret of the Golden Flower" translated by Richard Wilhelm and introduced by C.G. Jung and revealed the meaning of so many symbols of taoist alchemy.Not a very easy reading but it's worth the effort
