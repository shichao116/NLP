This is my favourite Malloren book so far! I am really in love with Brand. I knew I would like his story just from the bits and pieces I got of him in the other stories. I laughed, teared up a bit, and somehow everything worked itself out.Rosamunde is a delightful heroine you can get behind and Brand is so deliciously sexy. Like the hot guy with the awesome personality.I am happy to have bought this book and can not wait until Bey and Diana's story arrives in the mail
