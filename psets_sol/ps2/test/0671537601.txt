I never realized how connected Bob Hoover was to the fabric of aviation as well as the United States.  This was a book I could not put down.  The stories of his early test pilot days, WWII and later test piloting were rivoting.  It was amazing how he was remarkably able to recover some from very nasty situations.  He has crashed more planes than I have flown.
