Gavin De Becker's "The Gift of Fear" is the most astute and fascinating dissection of human intuition that I have ever read. As far as I know, there is nothing like it anywhere. De Becker describes -- by way of personal experience and anecdotes -- how we talk ourselves out of the inexplicable suspicions and bad feelings that could be danger signals we should attend to. In case after case, he demonstrates how we actually know what is at the root of these feelings - an unexpected flash of color in a rearview mirror, a man wearing a long coat on a hot day, an attacker closing a window - cues that can save our lives if we attend to the urges that they impel us to follow. De Becker also gives us insight into the criminal mind, helping victims to analyze their experiences and helping future targets avoid being victimized. Along the way, he describes how corporations and individuals can keep merely peculiar people from becoming dangerous. The newsman who tried to rid himself of an annoying fan through intimidation ended up alienating and humiliating the fan, ultimately driving him to murder. De Becker also helps us understand how to fire unwanted employees - firmly and professionally, but by allowing them their dignity.This book is fascinating to read and reread. The insights it provides into weird (though common) human behavior is very interesting, as is the length to which people go to talk themselves out heeding their inner voices! De Becker tells the story of a professor target by the Unabomber. This man had numerous chances to avoid opening the letter bomb that took his life, but each was rationalized away. While what happened to this man may be rare, many of us discount our feelings, considering them signs of weakness. De Becker, a man acquainted from an early age with violent behavior, might be too intense to invite to a cocktail party. Nonetheless, invite him into your life for the length of the book, and learn both about the peculiarities of our fellow humans and about the enormous and impressive gift - our intuition - that we often chose to ignore
