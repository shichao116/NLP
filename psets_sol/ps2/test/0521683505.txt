Extremely handy alphabetical format with all of the necessary considerations laid out in an interesting, eye-catching manner in Stahl's characteristic fashion. In addition there are pearls and tips about each drug's use which are informative and thought provoking. I would check it after ePocrates, and before seriously considering the use of any drug with which I am not very familiar. And it provides useful reminders and some, to me, new information about some of the drugs I thought I knew quite well.Pattison Esmiol, MD, Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychuatry, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center
