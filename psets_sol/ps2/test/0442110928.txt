This is a reprinted version of a book originally published in the late 40's, spiral-bound and intended to be a step-by-step trainer of methods used in traditional transparent watercolor and architectural rendering. Back then, papers were different but by recognizable European makers; paints were fewer (color choices too!) and methods of "paint-slinging" very "creative" as well! Kautsky was trained as an architect in Hungary and not a "Sunday" painter...hence his methodology was very traditional and "old-school" oriented. This is not a coffee table book-it is a concise study of picture-making, published in an historical period that didn't include the lavish color plates as today's offerings contain. This man could really draw! He had worked in the field for over 50 years by the time this book was offered by Reinhold, and he employed an economy of means practiced by only the best delineators of the period. Hence, his images are tight, well composed and clearly executed in a methodical and somewhat slow fashion (by today's standards). The "California Style" painters, for example, used symbols and a sort of shorthand collection of shapes and colors in their paintings, to convey their expressive imagery-not Kautsky! His are decidedly architectural renderings employing accurate perspective and traditional compositional devices. For images and techniques that are decidedly contemporary variations on this, choose a book by Robert Wade, or John Lovett or Al Stine, whose simplifications may be more appealing and certainly more colorfully printed with loads of useful, "painterly" advice. But, Kautsky's tree and wood renderings, roads and landscapes among other subjects are stunningly true to species and form and fashioned with only a couple of brushes which will require dilligent practice to replicate. Serious designers, architectural delineators and art students willing to practice with a vengeance, will discover Kautsky's instructional insights and methods to be invaluable and not equalled by ANY of today's current publishing artists.
