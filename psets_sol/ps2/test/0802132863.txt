Ian Black and Benny Morris have compiled the most knowledgable and conclusive information on the Israeli intelligence services.  Not only does this book provide factual details, it combines incredible quotes and  sources.  Black and Morris must have spent decades gathering the  information, but this book is definitely the best.  Although it is well  over 500 pages, the read is rather quick.  Again, one of the greatest books  I have read...excellent choice!
