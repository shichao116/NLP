Robin Briggs promises an intriguing concept-- social history of witches-- but fails to really deliver.  This book is overly anecdotal, rambling, and too long.  Occasionally, Briggs starts to sketch a reasonable and viable  hypothesis about the topic at hand, but then inevitably veers off into a  loosely-related anecdote or another topic altogether.  If you have no  background in European history and know nothing about the witchcraft trials  outside America, this book would be acceptable.  However, if you would like  to learn more, this is NOT the place to start
