Wow! What a great book! This was an awful lot of fun! A smart, gutsy, likeable heroine with some very cool powers on the run from some really scary bad guys -- this book really kept me on the edge of my seat. Lots of action and adventure, thrown in with some romance and a fascinating take on the concept of the djinn. I couldn't read it fast enough!  The perfect beach book for summertime reading
