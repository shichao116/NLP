You can come out of the other end of this book knowing just about everything a layman needs to know about genetics.  Matt Ridley never fails to inform yet in such an entertaining way you're learning without really knowing it.  I wish all textbooks were written this way.It's a fascinating book, a story of genetic research told by highlighting each of the chromosomes and picking some interesting genes from within.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in genetics, no matter how scientifically-minded you are
