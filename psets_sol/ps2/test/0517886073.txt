This book reads more like a autobiography then a self help book. Dodson spends most of her time talking about her life and her sexual awakening. While some of it is insightful, a lot of it comes very close to blathering stupidity and an odd kind of boastfulness.The first chapters deal with her unsatisfactory sex life and her sexual encounters with her wonder lover. The art work is nice, but otherwise, it's skippable. She then goes on to her workshops and her spreading the news about masturbation. This part makes her sound like a loonie on a mission, but it's mildly entertaining.The part that I bought this book for, the how to masturbate section, encompassed less then 20 pages and was vague, frustrating and unhelpful. Anyone, with a bit of thought, could have figured out most of these techniques.Over all, honestly, it was a bit dull. If you have issues about your genitals, think that masturbation will make you blind, or just want a laugh over someone who likes to jerk off in group settings, buy this. If you want help with techniques, practical advice, or how to use toys, find another book
