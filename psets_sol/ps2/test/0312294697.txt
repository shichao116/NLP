Edvige Giunta writes eloquently of the nuances of ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality as it pertains to Italian American women writers. She has excavated the rich mother lode of an important cultural literary tradition that has too long been overlooked and undervalued. The literary "accent" that Giunta so keenly identifies lies in being "other", outside the mainstream, accepted elite, white male literary point-of-view. The candance of Italian American women's writing is deep and resonant and as diverse as the women who put pen to paper. It echoes our relationships to time, place, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation--and gives voice to our multi-varied identities. Giunta's book sheds light on an important literary lineage, identifying both established and emerging Italian American women writers. Her contribution to the Italian American literary criticism is invaulable and long overdue. Giunta's prose is as compelling as her thesis. This book speaks to scholars, writers, and readers of all backgrounds. Read it
