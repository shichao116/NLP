One of the most important things that can be done to encourage adolescent and young women to make safe, responsible decisions about their sexuality is to provide them with the tools and information necessary to make those decisions.  Amber's book, Hooking Up-A Girls All-Out Guide to Sex and Sexuality, does just that, and does it in a very balanced way.  She discusses the positives AND the negatives associated with a variety of behaviors and decision-making processes, and presents girls with the information necessary to understand how and why their bodies and emotions function as they do.Amber writes in a conversational tone and with a sense of humor that makes the book an easy read and, perhaps more importantly, easy to comprehend.  The book covers just about everything young women need to know in a short, concise format that is not intended to be a treatise on the subject, but rather an introduction to what they need to know to understand how their sexuality impacts them and their bodies at this age.  It is also a good read for guys who want some insight into what women face as they learn to manage their own sexuality.This book accomplishes its purpose so well that I have placed it at the top of my "Must Read" list for teenagers and young women.  I wish I had had this book or a book like it when I was in high school, and I'd definitely recommend that any parent give it to their daughter
