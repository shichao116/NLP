It's rare you see such gushing praise for an essay collection, more impressive is the average length of these Amazon reviews.  It seems the reviewers like to look at their own words as much as this author does.I didn't like this book for a simple reason.  There are better things to read than varied complaints and woes about changing times.  Sure, sometimes it is good but these lopsided views.... he is as focused on discontent as he is verbose.If that sounds good to you, buy this book..... most people have stuff to do
