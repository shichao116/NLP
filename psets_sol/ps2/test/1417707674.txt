Thom Jones writes like a person may think. He truly paints a picture of vivid colors and images in your head with this series of short stories. The three Vietnam stories at the front of the book make this book of short stories worth puchasing alone. So good infact that I had to read one of the stories over the second I finished reading it. Truly an incredible writer
