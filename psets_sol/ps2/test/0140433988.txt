While this was a faster paced book than usual for Dickens, and expertly written, the marked darkness of this piece is hard to avoid. Dickens is known for tackling the serious issues of his time and this is no different. He paints a scathing portrait of industrialism and a world only big enough for cold hard facts. The novel takes place in Coketown, a place laden with serpentine smoke and oppressed by the heavy burden of industry; a place where intelligence is to be fostered, but the imagination quashed.I suppose my only complaint is that this book is totally devoid of comic characters. Dickens' ability to caricaturize is amazing and he deprives his readers of that comic relief here. It really could have used a "Uriah Heep" or "Fagin." Sure, these characers are villainous, but also darkly comic...characters one loves to hate. Without this element, Hard Times leaves one a bit depressed.Don't get me wrong, it is a good read, I just cannot put it into the same category with David Copperfield and Dombey and Son
