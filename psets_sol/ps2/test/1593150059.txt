This was a very good book. I really felt Adriane's pain when Storm left. Adriane's parents moved to who-knows-where and left Adriane alone with her strange grandmother. Adriane feels unwanted. The only person who really understands her is Stormbringer. They both feel the same pain. When Storm finds out that there are more like him, he is tempted to run with the pack of mistwolves. He does, and Adriane is left all alone. Adriane can't go on without Storm and trys to contact him. But something happens, and Adriane is pushed through a portal, into the Shadowlands. There, Adriane is attacked and a strange boy rescues her. She finds out his secrets. They are really surprising. Adriane meets the fairimentals and recieves an important message. All in all, a great book for anyone who loves to read.
