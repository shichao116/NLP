1970s suburbian life style is the setting of this compelling novel. This story follows the lives and drama surrounding a small town where four beautiful girls try to break free of their strict parents in very sinful ways. The book is narrated by a small groups of boys who become bewitched and pulled into the drama of these young girls lives. I absolutely love this book it was so real and full of heart and sisterly honour. That may not sound so great to those who understand the kind of honour these girls have with one anothers but its a wonderful novel that isnt for the faint at heart. It hits hard into a common death and problem among young girls and young boys
