Very few books have influenced me deep down as has Lust for Life, the classic biography of Van Gogh, arguably the greatest impressionist of all times.Gogh, led a life in extreme poverty till his death, partly because his impressionist style was not accepted as a ''style'' until much later, and partly because he refused to give in however difficult it got.The life:Van Gogh led a remarkable life. And a very painful one.Despite being one from a well placed family, he led himself from one occupation to another - unable to find himself suited to any one of them. Misunderstood by everyone except his dear brother Theo, Gogh was forever alone. His sensitivity, especially to the pain felt by other people often led him to put himself through punishing tasks and challenges.An episode from his life that was particularly touching was when he was serving as a preacher in an impoverished mining town named Borinage. In an attempt to save men from dying from the mercilessly cold winter plus dangling unemployment, Gogh gives away all his clothes, wrapping himself with grocery bags and utility box wrappers.In another episode, Gogh walks for days without food and proper shoes, ultimately leading himself to a breakdown.The author brings Gogh in front of our eyes. We could see him. We could feel him. And of course, we cried as well.The artist :During the course of his life, Gogh discovers his relationship with the (sketch and charcoal) pen and later colors. He painted as he saw things, and anyone who has seen his paintings knows that they speak volumes.The author very effectively delves into the psyche of Gogh through his experiences. Gogh's involvement with the people around him made way for his intense portrayals in form of sketches and paintings. If you have seen ''the potato eaters'' you know what I mean.The book tells the stories behind many of his now greatly acclaimed paintings; from potato eaters, to self portrait, to the painting on ''Pigeon'' the prostitute, to starry nights..each one now seems to throb with life when I see them.The greatness:Is in the fact that the human face of Gogh neither diminished nor tired throughout his life. The dazzling brilliance shined though the darkest nights. Creativity never gave in. In the end, the body gave in, the spirit did not.The writer:Brings life into sentences,paragraphs and pages. It seems I've known Gogh all my life.Read it once to check for yourself
