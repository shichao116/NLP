At the end of the semester My suitmate at college let me borrow this book. I had just broken up with my boyfriend and I decided to give this book a try. This is an excellent book for both  girls and guys and I would reccommend it to anyone. I am so glad I read it and I am actually rereading it now. I wish I had read it before I had started dating because it has a lot of practical applications. I found it had many helpful points about relationships and how to go about things in a relationship. Even if you are not dating or in a courtship, this book has much practical, Biblical advice that can be used. Joshua Harris uses different stories and experiences in his life to show what he is talking about. So if you get a chance this is a MUST read
