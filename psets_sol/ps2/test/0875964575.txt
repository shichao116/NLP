A good book and overview of Prefontaine's life and the one you will see in quality running stores. Very good capsule on his life and racing competition with a great set of pictures. However, Pre is such a fascinating subject whose rash and bold method of running also ocurred during the peak of the Amnerican running boom that there never seems to be enough information or pictures of him. I keep thinking someone will write another deeper book. Jordan's book is well worth reading and possibly the best book on Pre but the obvious problem was Pre's life waswas too short with a lot more to give. You always will feel like you're missing another chapter, literally as his life ended so prematurely. As far as Europe goes, he had lots of development success running other events such as a 3:53 mile and with more time and if the AAU provided more athletic support, he appeared to be refining his skills for a great run in 1976. Wouldn't it be great if Track and Field News got serious and with their archives got a full blown biography about his life, wins and losses, and provided an indepth collection of racing pictures perhaps in a coffee table size book where the pictures would literally leap out at you? Losses, although rare such as Dick Burkle's great indoor upset and Pre's difficulty with Brendan Foster with an illness issue, were still interesting adding to charcter development. There has to be the that one great book coming. By the way, Booklist's review refers to Pre's barely missing a medal in the Munich Olmpic 5,000 meters as the "two mile run"?
