The Red Book is logically organized by model year series, and within each series Paternie highlights the changes year-over-year. VIN numbers can be easily bracketed into the various production runs, and engine/drivetrain specs, suspension, wheel, and braking setups, interior trim/color combinations, and various special edition anomalies are all well presented. My own 911 search is currently ongoing, but the Red Book has helped me very quickly narrow down my choice range and verify new offerings as I encounter them
