I enjoyed this book, for two reasons.  First, it gives us the accumulated wisdom of one of the best investors ever in our markets.  Second, the annotations by Zweig provide some updated historical context, so that we can see how the environment has changed.  Graham's central point is to invest in such a way as to maintain a margin of safety against killing losses, and he outlines some methods for doing that for both defensive and enterprising investors.  My main, but small, complaint is that the stories and case studies run on too long for my taste and tend to be somewhat dated, but the fundamental principles he describes are still sound
