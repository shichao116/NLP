I've nearly finished reading Crown of Swords, Book 7 of Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time series.  As anticipated, it has been very enjoyable.  I did not actually "read" his first 6 books. I listened to them thru Audible.com since I am on the road so much.  Having heard the names and places it was interesting to see them written.  I would give the book a distinctive thumbs up if you enjoy the fantasy style of Robert Jordans's writing
