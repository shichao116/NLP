Contrary to the opinion of the reviewer of December 2003, John Currin is indeed an excellent draftsman. How could it be otherwise, since his finished works have the unmistakable marks of an Old-World master's powers of observation - which demands a fundamental drawing ability. If this isn't evidence of Currin's ability, may I add that, as a high-school acquaintance of the man (I was a year behind him), I saw firsthand his many sketches in the classroom studio. Any volume of his work is more than enough at this exciting stage of his career
