This is Volume 9 in the collection of her true crime articles. There are ten chapters, the title comes from the first and longest case. There is no index. Murders usually involve people who know each other, family or friends rather than strangers (as in serial killers). Rule had been a police officer and psychology student before she turned to journalism to support herself and her children. Most of her articles dealt with crimes in the northwest. Rule had worked at the Seattle Crisis Center alongside Ted Bundy. "Everybody like Ted" (p.96). The end of the long first chapter has the solution for the first murder, someone serving two life sentences for similar murders!Why does Seattle have the reputation as "the center of the universe for serial killers" (p.124)? [Too much coffee?] I once read the claim that England had so many strange murders because of their very high consumption of sugar, not the cold, rainy climate. Could serial killers flourish in a warm, sunny climate like southern California and Los Angeles? "The Lonely Hearts Killer" has an answer. It seems to be that serial killers are most feasible in large cities where there are a lot of transients and other opportunities (Cleveland's Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run). Such things could never happen in a small town with only a few thousand people, like in rural Kansas. Or could it?The various cases mostly happened in the 1960s, when Ann Rule was younger and more likely affected by their reports. These stories show Rule's narrative style and were originally written for magazines. Each is self-contained and are not consistent as to background. They all originate from love (or lust), or a desire for money. The love of money is still the root of evil. Do the rich murder for love or lust, or is that just another sign of poverty? Ann Rule was invited to work on the VICAP task force, a program to keep track of murders in various places to detect serial killers.If you've never read any of Ann Rule's books, this seems to be as good as any. "The Captive Bride" ends with advice about a dangerous relationship. "Bad Blind Date" tells of the danger from a stranger with mental problems. The largest percentage of women who are murdered are killed by men they loved and trusted, not serial killers (p.319). "The Highway Accident" tells about what seemed like an ideal marriage, but where the husband led a double life. "You Kill Me - Or I'll Kill You" has the oddest, bizarre murder in this book. And the strangest punishment![This is from the paperback version.]
