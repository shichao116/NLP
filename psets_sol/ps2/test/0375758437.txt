Bobbie Ann Mason's characters are so real that you feel like you'd meet them when you're at the grocery store or Target buying laundry detergent or frozen waffles.  Some of them, I think, are my relatives (or me). She manages to create people who are unique, yet shows us the parts of them that are just like us.  I've read and reread this story collection so many times and never tire of it.  I've bought every book she's written and am particularly fond of her short stories.
