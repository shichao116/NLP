As a grad student, I didn't want to spend alot of time reading about nutrition. This book allows you to quickly skim the vitamin supplement guidelines, or read the entire book and learn a new approach to eating.   Information is cited with scientific studies, so you know this isn't just  his &quot;philosophies.&quot; I am now taking what I've learned and have a  whole new approach to nutrition and weight-loss.  I have been a yo-yo  dieter for years, and no longer have sugar or fastfood cravings. You'll  learn that understanding the role of vitamins and minerals is really the  key to living a healthier life. I understand now what I was doing wrong:  too much carbohydrates and no protein, which was why I had no energy at the  gym amongst other problems. Teaches the truth about saturated fats, why  hydrogenated fats are bad, and about Omega-3/Omega-6 EFA's (flaxseed oil).  Highly recommended. I've purchased 4 copies for family members
