"The Rape of Nanking" is not for the squeamish or faint-hearted. However, it is a work that should be applauded.  The text, as well as pictures will disturb you. All wars yield stories of atrocities, but the treatment of the Chinese by the Japanese military, sanctioned, I believe, by the Japanese heirarchy, bear a great resemblance to the Nazi's treatment of the Jewish people of WWII.Man's inhumanity to man is well illustrated in this great work by Iris Chang.These atrocities leave a black mark on the history of the Japanese government as well as a black mark on those governments around the world that sat idly by,  knowing it was happening, and choosing to do nothing.  The 'holocaust' is throughout our history books, as it should be, but   what I will call "The holocaust of the Pacific' will not be found there.  That, in itself, is another tragedy.
