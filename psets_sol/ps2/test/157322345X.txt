This book and Sakyong Mipham's more recent "Ruling Your World," are permanent fixtures in my library.  Sometimes Buddhist writings can be difficult to understand or relate to, but this author has a Western background and is able to communicate ideas in ways that are easy to identify with for people without a background in Buddhist thought.  Our culture and the media encourage "monkey mind," and it's hard to gain control of inner thought processes in a world that constantly communicates "Buy More, Do More, Be More."  This book offers a means of calming the internal turmoil and developing your mind to reach its potential.Especially helpful, was the practical information on meditation, such as how to sit, what posture to assume and when to meditate.  Sometimes authors assume a certain level of sophistication of their readers that is unwarranted and the discussion starts out on an esoteric level and leaves the reader wondering how to proceed.  If you are new to meditation practice, the materials at the end of the book will answer your practical questions, while the chapters on calming the mind and developing your meditation practice will point you in the right direction.  I also got a great deal of benefit from the chapters dealing with the pitfalls and plateaus to expect when developing a practice.  I'd give this book 6 stars if I could
