Like most people, I am inundated with new books and papers that need my attention.But I always make the time to read anything that Sapolsky writes. This book is a collection of essays that show once again, that we have an extraordinarily brilliant iconoclast in our midst. Time and again he demonstrates that he is not afraid to say when he does not know something, but that he also uncommonly good at coming up with new questions and new solutions.I suggest reading this at the rate of a chapter a day, and meditating on what you have learned: you will not regret it!The whole thing is witty, unconventional and brilliant
