I used the second edition book back when I took (and aced) the VTNE for my Oregon certification. Let me also state that I "grandfathered in" as a Certified Veterinary Technician, meaning that what I knew, I'd picked up along the many years working in the field, as opposed to a formal academic environment.  Years later,  I used the 3rd edition for the California State Board Exam.  The tests are similar enough that I passed the latter with flying colors (after all, the science is the same, regardless of geography!)  I owe much of the success in both cases to the Colville guide.I am now an instructor for the Vet Tech program at a local college, and recommend this book as an adjunct for studying--the CD-ROM is really helpful.  It offers immediate feedback with the correct answers, which is much like using flash cards, only neater.Whether you're a student studying for your first Board Exam, or a veteran of the field in need of a refresher course, this book does not disappoint.
