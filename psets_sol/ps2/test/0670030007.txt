This book makes you care again for Andy Warhol.  In too many books and articles about Warhol, the authors seem to have some sort of vendetta against him and just want to tear him and his work down.  Wayne Koestenbaum cares a great deal for Warhol, and his work.  It is his work that is central to this look at his life, though from the start there is no denial of his homosexuality which Warhol himself desperately tried to keep somewhat hidden.  You should have something of a familiarity with Warhol's work and life, this isn't really a good introduction to it, but it is the best interpretation of it that I have ever read.  It is written with a great deal of sympathy for one of the 20th Century's greatest artists, who most critics - both hetro and homo - try to denigrate and destroy
