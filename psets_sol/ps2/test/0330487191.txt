One of the most satisfying novels I have ever read. In my admittedly non-erudite opinion, it is the author's best work. At the least, it is his most honest one, free of a certain smug condescension and pretentiousness that seems to creep into his later works. The writing is richly detailed (none of it superfluous), with a brilliantly understated sense of hapless comedy underscoring the tragedy of Mohun Biswas's life. If you like prose that is not pompous, full of gentle wit, and clearly in the hands of a master, and a story of rare poignancy - this is your book
