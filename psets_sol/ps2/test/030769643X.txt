I have had this book for.....wow, almost 50 years. My daughter was here yesterday and tried to steal it from me. I cannot give it up. It is in pretty good shape but there are many stains from use.I ordered her one today, even though she is no longer a kid. I am intrested to see if all the recipes are in here. I understand the "Hobo Joe" thing and am not surprized, but how about the peanut butter creams, and the egg nog? These two recipes were made with raw eggs, a big no-no now. I do not care, I never got sick, and only use fresh eggs. The peanut butter creams were the thing my daughter wanted to make. They are her favorite and she remembers making them as a child. They taste like payday candy bars.The cookie recipes are great! I also love the tuna burgers and eggs in a frame.Yes, the book has a few items that are just put together, but this helps promote ideas, and are easy for kids to do.This book is NOT just for children. I cannot bear to part with mine!!!
