This 1989 work is a good introduction to the style of writing that Saul Bellow became famous for.  It is a light-hearted story of intrigue mixed with heart-warming characters who are so vividly portrayed.  For the uninitiated this is a good beginning for those who would dare to read more by Bellow.  If you like this you will love Herzog and Humbolt's Gift.  If not, it is my guess that neither of these works would be a satisfying read and even difficult to finish
