Madeleine Albright presents history, politics, governance and faith as issues that must be considered in any analysis of the current state of the world. As one who leans right, I was unsure how far to the left this book would be. While making several comments that the current adiministration has made mistakes (some big, some small), there is no shrillness. Rather, Dr. Albright suggests that terrorists should be ostracized by Islam, as these people are not true adherents to the faith, and that to do that effectively, the Western governments must work with Middle Eastern governments to end the cycle of violence and that to do that BOTH sides must revisit how they respond when some poor, mixed up kid blows himself/herself up
