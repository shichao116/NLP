As a teacher of Wicca for many years, I'm always looking for better materials to use for training.  I am grateful to Ms. Sabin for providing what will undoubtedly be the introductory book I will recommend for the foreseeable future.  She presents the basics without pushing any given path or tradition, often presenting varying interpretations and viewpoints in a non-judgemental manner.  This is a solid foundation for seekers to use as a springboard to whatever flavor of Wicca they choose to explore.I appreciate that she addresses ethics within Wicca, which many authors seem to avoid, or present in a highly simplistic manner.The book is clearly meant for beginners, hence the title, and is possibly the best overall introduction I have yet seen.
