A novel filled with adventure, excitement, and deeds of daring do, taking place sometime during the 20th century, in and around the Mediterranean. The story is described in the third person following dashing hero Dirk Pitt and loyal friend, Al Giordino as well as following the diabolical villains.  It is a story filled with danger and action combined with amazing descriptions.  Recommended age 14 and up for innuendoes and descriptions of violent events.This novel is not a simple read, but it is not cut and dry either.  Cussler is and amazing author who has a gift for expressing description and emotion.  Even though the story is told in third person, as a reader you get a real feel for the characters and become amerced in the story.  The story is mostly centered on the charming Dirk Pitt, an unusual hero who always manages to land on his 1feet.  Pitt is not a common hero, his features are attractive, but not quite movie star quality so he relies on his wit and people skills to help him `get in the door' so to speak.  From the first three pages I was lost in this book.  Cussler does an amazing job setting up descriptions to make the reader feel like they are in those places and know those people.  The quote "his large brown hands moved efficiently, pulling back on the control column and the plane aimed its flat snout at the sun", is a taste at some of the imagery and description used.  I spent a majority of this book wanting to be there, wanting to be in the action.  Cussler is truly a gifted writer who embraces his spirit of adventure.
