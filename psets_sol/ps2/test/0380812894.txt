Everyone has commented on how  "complex" this book is. Well, it baffled me! I trudged through every chapter hoping it would get better. Instead I was bogged down in the mire of time travel that was taken as casually as changing one's socks(pop in, pop out). The same character was able to be in the same place at the same time & yet it was not a paradox. (How do you like your older self telling your younger self what to do?) It didn't seem to be leading anywhere. The only plot I understood was the creationist spy subplot.  This book has a point in how far fanatics (of any kind) will go.Other than that, I consider this book so tied in knots that I am disappointed to have to say it was a waste of time & money for me. Maybe Sci Fi readers would like it.  :
