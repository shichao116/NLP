"The grave was substandard." If that opening line won't capture your attention, nothing will. I'm not terribly fond of romance fiction, but the suspense and action in this one held me captive. I could hardly wait to finish it, and when I closed the cover, I said, "wow."  The only reason I gave it only four stars is because I could have done without the steamy sex scenes. But that's Ms. Brown's genre, and she's very good at it.
