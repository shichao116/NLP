The weighty set of examples packed into THE DRAWING BOOK: A SURVEY OF DRAWING: THE PRIMARY MEANS OF EXPRESSION should deter no real artist: it provides an outstanding gathering of works by artists, architects, sculptors, filmmakers and more to demonstrate the versatility of drawing. Add essays by curators Kate Macfarlene and Katharine Stout and art writers Charles Darwent and you have an in-depth survey through five artistic themes - measurement, nature, the city, dreams, and the body. It's the color plates which stand out here, as silent testimony to the range of expression drawing can bring to each theme and thought.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch
