BEHIND THE SCENES WITH COUNT OLAF appears to be the typical behind the scenes movie book. However, once you begin reading the pages and looking at the pictures, you realize it's not. The whole concept behind the book is that Count Olaf has "edited" the original BEHIND THE SCENES BOOK. The dialogue that is supposed to go with the pictures is often covered over what appears to be scratches of paper and tape that are written on, explaining what Count Olaf wants you to know. It's a cute sight gag, usually only seen in books for young children. However, for anyone who knows anything about THE SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, you know that the gimmick fits perfectly into the general tone and theme of the books and upcoming movie. There are lots of photos from the film and a few surprises for those who haven't seen the movie yet and who have only read the books. So, why don't you make your uncle Olaf proud and buy this book
