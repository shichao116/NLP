I've read 2 or 3 Highsmith books, this being the best. The story may be well known since it was made into a movie, but I'll briefly outline it here. A rootless soul is encouraged to go to Europe to find the wayward son of an acquaintance. Having no real identity, but with impeccable social sense he ingratiates himself to the man and his girlfriend and lives vicariously through them and their carefree, self-assured, and opulent lifestyles. Soon vicarious is not enough, and a darker and chilling spiral of murder, depravity, and most of all complete pathological behavior take over. The mood is the strength of the book, as it is for the movie, and is at once dark and enthralling, appealing in highbrow manner to morbid curiosity.A great story, a cold spider-web of a book on the darkest side of human nature
