I was lent Deepak Chopra's Cassette version of this book long ago and approached it anticipating little value. I was wrong; I enjoyed it! For someone who enjoys attacking problems from multiple angles, this work gave me a greater spiritual dimension for my ongoing experiments with mind and body integration.We all have to start somewhere, and I don't understand the malice of those who expect every book they read to have everything they need. We don't often write for the money; you'd be surprised how little an author makes from each book they sell. I write first for the clarity, and I think Mr. Chopra wrote Ageless Body, Timeless Mind for the right reasons as well.One key difference between Deepak and history's philosophers is that they are dead and he isn't. Those who can, have to speak. As not all men are philosophy majors and those who are, are not so all at the same time, someone who listens will be at a stage in life where they will get something valuable out of it.As the author of Moral Armor, I'm beyond it now philosophically, but I feel no need to impune his work. His was one of many stepping stones from the self-help eighties for which I am thankful
