This book is a wonderfully wrought exploration of romantic trust and religious faith. Considered one of Greene's "Catholic" books (he was an adult convert to Catholicism), the story is set in an African outpost of the British Empire in the early days of World War II.The local chief of Police, an Englishmen, has overstayed his tour of duty--"gone native," as the saying goes. He has grown wise in the ways of the local tribespeople, and no longer attempts to impose a British version of "justice" on their squabbles and petty corruption. His wife loathes the place, but he is quite satisifed with his position. He was in line for the top colonial administration post, a step up his wife longs for, but he is passed over.Here, too, the central issue is: who do you trust? Various Arab traders are smuggling diamonds out of the colony, and all police attempts to discover the methods come to naught; the police are suspected of being "on the take" and the wily traders do in fact offer a variety of bribes. Our hero is honest, but is suspected of being dishonest.In his wife's absence, our hero has the misfortune of falling passionately in love with a younger Englishwoman who is marooned in the colony. This sets up the story's central conflict: both women trust him, and yet he has to abandon or lie to one. Which one? This moral dilemma--which bond of trust to break--is unresolvable.At one point in the book, a character considers suicide as an escape from the cruel grip of a moral double-bind. But killing oneself is a mortal sin and against God's wishes; but then, isn't God forgiving? Which can the character truly trust? The church's rule that suicide is unforgivable, or God's limitless forgiveness of all sins, once one repents?Exactly how deep is your trust in God's forgiveness? It is only when the burden of sin is great that you really ponder what faith and trust in God really mean.
