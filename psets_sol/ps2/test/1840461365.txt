At about 60 pages with 200 words/page, this is more an essay than a book. At the beginning of the 20th century, SCIENCE had a distinguished status as the only producer of objective truths. This position was supported by various philosophies designed to distinguish scientific truth from other truths. This book describes the challenges to this status of science produced in the wake of Kuhn's work and responses to this challenge within the scientific and philosophical community. It is nice, brief and comprehensible introduction to the &quot;sociology of scientific knowledge&quot; requiring only a modicum of prior knowledge. My only complaint is that it is too sketchy at several points; I would have liked to see several of themes developed at greater length. This is the price of brevity
