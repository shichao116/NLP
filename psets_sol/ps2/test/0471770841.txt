Blogging for Dummies by Brad Hill is a terrific resource for new to moderate bloggers.  I've been blogging for almost six months, but I learned an enormous amount of information from Hill's book.  His writing is irreverent and witty and full of what you need to know to really make your blog stand out from the crowd.  I still have to figure out how to shrink a picture to 50k, but once I get that down, there'll be no stopping me!  The book covers Blogger.com, TypePad, Yahoo360, MSN, and several other sites in detail so a new user can jump write in and get a great site going.  His instructions are basic and easy to follow, and he addresses the pros and cons of each site well with pictured examples.  It had great info for me to get moving, but I think I'll end up purchasing this book, because he has a great deal of info inside for more experienced bloggers who want more control over their sites.
