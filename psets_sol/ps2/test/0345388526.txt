this books was pretty good, it certainly filled the need i felt.  some of the characters situations are a little boring and are not developed to well.  but the story is great, when i read it i look at it like a modern day army fighting a wwII army.  technology of the lizards is about what our technology is now, so that make's it interesting.  it's not the best he could have made it but it is definitely worth reading, it can become addictive which is good, i recommend it
