I just loved this book. It was such a real look at what coal miners and their families had to go through in the early 1900's. Set in West Virginia and Kentucky, it follows two families and the struggles they go through trying to free themselves and their friends of the coal company's brutal leadership.I'm not going to summarize this book, cause I'd be here all day, and it would be one long review, but I can't recommend it enough. I had no idea that this all-out war between miners and company officials even took place. And the brutality of it was absolutely heartbreaking. These people just wanted the freedom to work, get paid fairly for their time, and be able to spend their money wherever they wanted to without being in debt to the company store. They wanted to be able to provide sufficiently for their families (most of which consisted of 5-6 children), and live and work in a safe environment.Upon finishing this book, I immediately picked up the sequel 'Unquiet Earth', which follows the offspring of the families in this book. Though this was at times very difficult to get through, I'm glad I read it, and I look forward to the continuing story of this very brave and courageous family.
