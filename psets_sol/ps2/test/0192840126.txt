This small great book written by an intellectual, makes very clear that Richard Wagner's work is something that very few persons really can understand and really enjoy. Many people really &quot;believe&quot; the are enjoying Wagner's works, and that's the paradoxe of so many Wagnerians in times where persons are not really interested very much in deep and serious appreciaton of almost everything. It's very useful to keep in mind how many books have been written about Richard Wagner's life and personality with absolute lack of perception with respect of the importance of his art, in order to evaluate how good and constructive is to have the opportunity to read and read again this wonderful book about music and culture. I stronlgy recommend it to people that insist to schedule Wagner inside the Opera seasons arround the world.  Dr. Juan Merello-Galasso, M.D
