How to Write a Damn Good Novel is billed as "a step-by-step no nonsense guide to dramatic storytelling." I don't know about the step-by-step part, but Frey's advice is definately no-nonsense and will help you create dynamic stories.I sat down to read this book with a packet of post-it notes by my side. I marked all the important points I thought I'd need to remember for later. At the end, I had a thick rainbow along the spine. I couldn't get more than 3 pages without finding some gem I just had to make sure not to forget.I think a lot of the other reviewers might be correct when they say this advice is not necessarily earth shattering and can be found else where. But there is a difference. Frey does it with more clarity, more punch. And why buy six writing books to get all the advice you can get in this one?I can't go wrong with this one. Even though I didn't agree with some of his advice, I still found his guide inspired me to write better and make my character sizzle. I have a lot of writing guides on my bookshelf, but this is one of my favorites
