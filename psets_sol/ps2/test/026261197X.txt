--I just wanted to add another five-star rating for this insightful, concise, and fascinating book.--The author currently teaches psychology at Knox College and has performed several original studies researching the effects of material-oriented values on perceived well-being and health. Several people with outstanding credentials have favorably commented on this book, and it is suited for a non-specialized reader.--The author develops several points: first, selfishly materialistic values naturally reinforce insecurity and discontent; second, such values diminish personal freedom and authenticity; third, affluence rarely (if ever) leads to much happiness or satisfaction; and fourth, materialism detracts from meaningful relationships between ourselves and others (and between ourselves and nature, and between ourselves and, well, ourselves). The author points out that materialism is not some inherent and unique evil within American culture, but seems to be a product of secondary developments (like mass marketing and advertising).--The author provides several alternatives to materialism and overconsumption, but there are no "easy fixes." On the other hand, it's not all that difficult for individuals to begin to change.-- The author neglected to point out the high social cost of materialism for the image of this country.  Materialism has cost us a great deal in terms of oil wars, our financial dependence on China, and an image as a greedy and lazy group. Some of the research he uses in his bibliography are secondary sources, and several studies would seem best described as pilot studies rather than landmark research.  He also fails to point out the paradox that in this cradle of materialist values, we have a unique freedom to leave our culture aside at little cost (in other words, no one is pointing a gun at our heads and telling us we need to buy stuff.  We can take the responsibility to break out at any time.). He also seems somewhat oblivious to the growth of materialism among newly-rich nations like China, who seem ready to teach us a few lessons about materialism.--I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious how people think they need a couple of BMW's and a million-dollar house to be happy.  It certainly made me question some of my assumptions about  the relationship between material and my well-being.
