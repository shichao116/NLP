This is an outstanding guide.  It brings together emergency preparedness and immediate action.  Bill and Janet have painstakingly researched all facets of the most likely injuries to occur in a disaster situation.  This is a must have resource guide because we know that in a major disaster situation local emegency services are beyond overtaxed and help may not show for hours or days.  The second half of the book on preparedness steps are divided by specific types of disasters - hurricane, earthquake, etc.  The guides, information, and just plain common sense solutions will save lives.  I wish I'd had this book during Hurricane Fran in North Carolina and Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico.  With my flashlight, NOAA radio, canned food, and &quot;It's a Disaster&quot; book, I'll be ready for the next one.  Buy one for yourself and one for everybody you care about
