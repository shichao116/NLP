This novel is probably one of my favorite books now. I always heard it was a good book, but I never knew until I read it for myself. It was such a well written book, at first I didn't think it was going to be so interesting because it was a lot about fishing. Also, when I found out it was a true story I think it made me enjoy it much more. I just loved how Norman and Paul were close and they both enjoyed to fish. I also watched the movie and that is probably one of my favorite movies now. I just thought it was a really cool book, and reading isn't my favorite book. I would definitely recommend this to someone who loves to read, or even people that don't like to read...because it's such a short but great novel :
