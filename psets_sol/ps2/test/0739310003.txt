Kellerman's last few books have been forgettable to say the least and I hoped that this would display the quality of his early writing.  While it was not a total waste of time, it came close.  Far too much print was devoted to the half-hearted team meetings of people in mud colored clothing as they outlined ever more convoluted theories as to who had done what to and with whom.  This  is yet another book that lacks credibility or suspense.
