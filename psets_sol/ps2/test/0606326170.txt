Farfallina and Marcel is a true story of friendship. It teaches us that even through natural changes in life we can remain friends. This is a favorite story of my 4 year old son who likes to hear it over and over again. The water color pictures are beautiful and add a soft warm feeling to the book. I believe it's message is timeless and we will enjoy reading it to our children for years to come
