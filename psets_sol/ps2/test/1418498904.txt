You read the reviews and you think you are getting a scholarly study of the history of the Templars ... boy are you going to be surprised!!  What you get is a slim book with one or two sentences concisely summing up the history of a given year and then it starts to confuse fact and fiction by discussing Holy Blood, Holy Grail, the DaVinci Code and conspiracy theories.This book is not worth a single penny ... it is the worst purchase I have ever made and thank heavens the author has a real job because it is obvious he is neither a writer nor a historian!!
