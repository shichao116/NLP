Although I don't consider myself a professional gambler, I am a very well-read amateur. I've read almost everything about the subject worth reading. Michael Konik's writing is head and shoulders above other authors who write about this subject. He's funny and entertaing but also informative, even if you think you already know everything about gambling. All my friends who like casinos get Konik's books for Christmas. Can't wait for his next one
