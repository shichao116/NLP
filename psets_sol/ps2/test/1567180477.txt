This is the worst book I have ever read on runes.  It's so negative it's dank and evil.  The information in it is all a repeat of other books, so there's nothing new here.  Unfortunately, the author (of questionable integrity in my opinion) even tells you how to kill someone you don't like. Yeah, so much for making the world a better place to live in for our kids. This is just the kind of book and attitude that makes people think that runes, tarot, and other divination systems are evil and the devil's work.  If you are interested in learning about runes, consider reading ANY other book on this subject.  You will be glad you missed this one, just like you are glad you didn't drink that glass of sour milk.  Instead you sniffed it first and realized it was putrid.  Best you sniff this book first because it really STINKS
