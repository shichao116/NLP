I would like to update my previous review upon realizing that the authors agreed with Judge Jones' decision insomuch as it pertained to the Dover School Board.  The authors agree with me and with Judge Jones that "the Dover school boardacted for clearly religious reasons rather than for a legitimate secular purpose", and that this in itself is unconstitutional.I am glad for a book like this which critiques the Kitzmiller v. Dover decision for being too broad in its scope, but I can see many good legal reasons why Judge Jones made the ruling that he did regarding the specific situation in Dover. There is a place in a legal ruling on Constitutionality for the perceptions that people have about ID, and not just about what the actual scientific arguments state. The motivation for the Dover board was not scientific as much as it was political and philosophical, and many ID proponents have made a bigger deal of religious implications of ID theory than on the actual scientific parts of ID theory itself. It is easy to see how in the popular culture wars ID gets confused with religion.While there is a false dichotomy between "known natural causes vs. supernatural causes" (a third option is unknown natural causes), there is also a false dichotomy between natural causes and design (a third option is natural intelligent design). Intelligent design and unknown natural causes - or even known natural causes for that matter - are very well compatible. In fact, much ID theory is drawn from observing natural evidence and bringing reason to bear on it, requiring no supernatural speculation whatsoever. An atheist scientist is just as capable of developing ID theory as a theistic one.There is an on-line article which I give 5 stars, which I wish had been more of a central theme to this book. It is called "A Textbook Case of Judicial Activism" by Seth L. Cooper and Leonard G. Brown III on the Discovery Website from Aug. 22, 2006. I also recommend a complete reading of Judge Jones' decision before tackling this book. In a nutshell, I agree with the judge's decision, but not its scope.  The authors are saying that he should not have tried to encompass all of ID in the trial, but given that he did do that, he should have then given ID a fair hearing as a defendant along with the Dover School Board.  It is perfectly reasonable to find the Dover School Board of acting with religious motivation, while finding ID in general to not be religious, especially considering that the Discovery Institute disagreed with the way the Dover School Board went about it.  ID and the Dover School Board were not playing on the same team, so it is unfair to find ID guilty by association
