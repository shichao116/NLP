I found the climax of this story-Bannister and Landy's race in Vancouver in 1955-to be almost impossibly gripping.  This whole book is just about perfect.  It is about a particular athletic quest, and it is also about a key transition period in sport.There were two related aspects to change at this time in track and field (and by extension other already professional sports).  The more obvious was the glaring contradiction between the old, 100% pure amateur model on the one hand, and the growing business and media phenomenon we know today on the other.  This subtext is brought out in the second part of the story, and especially in the sad tale of the straight-talking American, Wes Santee.But this was also a period of radical change in training methods.  Emil Zatopek, the Czech runner who won the 5,000 meter, 10,000 meter, AND marathon runs at the 1952 Olympics, is the key figure at the outset of the book.  His successes taught runners like Bannister, Landy, and Santee that more training, and harder training, would yield faster times.  The author outlines older ideas of conditioning that look ridiculously precious and half-hearted by modern standards.  As a masters athlete I was especially struck by this phase of the story, and the author does a good job of recapping the sorts of training the runners did throughout.The three are so characteristic of their countries, they could almost be fictional types.  American Wes Santee is brash and outspoken.  It is he who calls the financial bluff of the Neanderthal-like powers that ruled amateur athletics in his day, and it is he who is most severely victimized in the process.  (In a kind of entrapment scenario, he was given extra money by one set of AAU officials, and then banned for life by others.)  He is also impeded by having to subordinate his individual goals to that of his college team's.  John Landy is the hard-working Aussie, scrabbling along with the weakest home-grown competitive environment and the most grueling training routine.  Roger Bannister is the idealistic, individualistic and long-suffering Brit.  "When he goes out to run," one of his mates says, "he looks like a man going to the electric chair."  The sportswriters are awfully grandiose in the England of his day, and Bannister's contemplative manner is indeed a bit Shakespearean.I have only two small quibbles with this book.  One is tiny, especially for the non-athlete:  the author pokes good fun at old conditioning ideas, all the way back to the Greeks, but I would have preferred if he had brought modern physiological science to bear a little on the shifting trends of the early fifties.  By modern lights Bannister, Landy, and Santee did an awful lot of hammering.  This was much better than doing very little of anything, which was approximately the state of things before Zatopek came along.  But now we know that there are distinct benefits to long, slow distance training, even for four-minute races.  During his brief after-history of the mile record, the author mentions Peter Snell's twenty-mile training runs, but it's as if he's just another specimen in a zoo, and you're expected to merely roll your eyes and not care too much about the meaning of this.The other quibble is slightly larger, and it's simply that I think Bascomb could have put a bit more comic relief in this work.  Apart from the electric chair quote above, there are two incidents of celebrity mis-identification with regards to John Landy.  That's it.  I'm not looking for a barrel of monkeys hiding in the history of this very earnest endeavor, but as Hollywood knows, a bit of a tension/release cycle can heighten the ultimate effect of tension.  I like an author who stays in the shadows, but I think he might have lightened the tone occasionally-oh, maybe in introducing some of the overblown headlines of the day.  That sort of thing.  The book is written in Landy's running style-one pace; relentless.And make no mistake, it's an awesome book.  Very important:  you know who broke the four-minute mile barrier, but you probably don't know who won that Vancouver race.  So don't look at the pictures in the middle of the book until you're done with that!!!  The dramatic full-page shot on the left as Chapter 14 opens on the right?  HIDE IT!  Although as you see from my first sentence, knowing the outcome doesn't spoil things too much.
