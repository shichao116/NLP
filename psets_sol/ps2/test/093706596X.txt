This book can change not only the way that you think, but your life also. When we think we are talking to ourselves. And as the book clearly explains, we are only as good as we think, or say, we are. Many of us don't believe in our unlimited potential because life experience has told us not to. Trials and failures "tell" us that we have limits, weaknesses and excuses for failure, and over the years we begin to believe that. Why not change what we believe by changing our programming and our internal view of ourselves? This book makes it easy to begin doing so. This is more than a self-help, positive thinking book. This book is revolutionary, and if taken seriously, will change your life. I have started some of the techniques described in the book and can attest that this is powerful stuff. You will not be disappointed
