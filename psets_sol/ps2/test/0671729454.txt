I enjoyed most of this. It's told through Cathy's sons, Bart and Jory, who take turns in different chapters. Bart starts sneaking next door to see a mysterious old woman and her creepy butler. The butler is evil and the old woman...well, she's an kindly old lady. Bart discovers secrets of the past as he learns about the Foxworth clan. He becomes confused and very violent...It's up to someone to save him...Bart himself, who must confront his demons and confusion and save his own soul and the lives of those he loves before it's too late.There's not as much death in this book...not human death anyway. But like all original VC works, it will end in sadness and uncertainty; for like me, VC did not like happy endings. If you don't either, this book is for you, especially if you like kids and like to know their perspective on things. A very interesting read.
