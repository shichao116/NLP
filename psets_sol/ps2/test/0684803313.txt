Brian Tracy is without a doubt the most listened to self-develoment trainer in the world. My introduction to Brian was back in the 1980s with his psychology of achievement program on which this book is based.No one packs as much information into a program as does Brian Tracy. And what is even more important is that it is proven, tested and works for everyone.You will also find information here not available anywhere else. If you were to buy just one book, this one should be that book. It covers everything. Brian's techniques such as autosuggestion, affirmations, writing goal cards, and autogenic conditioning offer quick, permanent results.I never tire of Tracy. He is easy to read and a pleasure to listen to. Tracy constantly updates and improves his material as well. Put this book next to your nite stand.
