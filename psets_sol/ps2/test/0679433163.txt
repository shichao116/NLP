Tao Te Ching is not only a philosophical outlook on life, it is also a religious philosophy. Written around 4th and 5th centuries BCE, Tao Te Ching gives us the glimpse of the ancient non-Western philosophy, with D.C. Lau's in-depth introduction, it is a very inspiring and eye-opening read. The translation captures the essence of the work and gives the reader the ability to truly appreciate it. One of the main topics of the Tao Te Ching is the idea of non-action. "One who knows does not speak; one who speaks does not know", it is kind of an intellectual trap trying to write this review with the Tao philosophy in mind. If you know then do not teach, if you are ruler then rule as less as possible, if you are warrior then do not fight, etc. These examples are all representatives of non-action attitudes presented in Tao Te Ching. The best way to appreciate this work is to stop reading this review and purchase the book and be amazed
