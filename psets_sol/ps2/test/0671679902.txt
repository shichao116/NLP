As a food industry professional, I am quite selective about the books I choose to add to my cook book collection.A few of the reviewers here are correct in saying that the book is not 100% vegetarian but for me, not a vegetarian that's fine. The nice thing about cooking is that you do have the option of ommiting or adding ingredients to please your individual tastes.The recipes in this book are divided by country with recipes that cover all continents with the exception of Australia (and yes there is such a thing as Australian cuisine but good luck finding ingredients). There are soup, entree and dessert recipes for each region with very consice directions and useful footnotes where appropriate. No photos whatsoever, but if you follow the recipe carefully you shouldn't have to worry about that at all.This particular book was introduced to me by a very talented chef who used to work for me in my restaurant in Australia. I have since come accross two other chefs who have this book in their collection and use it for inspiration and motivation to come up with tasty vegetarian dishes!
