This is a terrific book on several levels.  First, just the love that these two women have for the people of Afghanastan and the picture they paint of life under the Taliban is interesting in and of itself.  In places it reads like a thriller, especially when they are arrested and their daring rescue.  Finally, just the incredible faith that these women exhibited under such trying circumstances is an inspiration to me.  Not that they are perfect, and they are the first to admit they struggled at times in those dark hours in prison, even bickering among themselves at times.  But in the end, their deep faith prevailed and a miracle occurred.   I felt like I was with them before, during and after their imprisonment, and that is a tribute to the great writing of this book.  And, by the way, much of the negatives reviews I've read here sound a lot more like anti-Christian bigotry then thoughtful criticisms.  Ignore them, and buy this inspirational, wonderful book
