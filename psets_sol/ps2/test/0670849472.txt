what I'd really like to see is Borges on Wagner. No such essay here. Still, this vol. has been worth it at twenty bucks. Getting a copy where I live is not easy: the libraries dont have it, and its hard to get this volume used, locally. Buy it. This has been some of the best twenty bucks I ever spent. 'A keystone for the home library.' This Borges vol. is one you want to keep on your shelf anyway.I cant remember the last time I spent such money on a book that was so worth it. My used copy of Oxford Shakespeare, perhaps, or paperback of Toynbees abridged history. (anticipating acquiring more Huxley.What we need is even more Borges non-fic trans. into Eng. Yet perhaps we are being too lazy, not learning our Spanish in order to read the originals.  A few such volumes together is likely to qualify for the label 'a liberal education.'. . . within a half hour or so of reading, I extracted much of the gold of the spirit of this book. It was worth it. In fact, I imagine a person would have to be very highly educated, not to extract some great gold from this book. I keep it. It isa gold mine in many respects. Gobs of well-presented info, and not just on lit. Dont avoid Borges because he seems to present something undefinable, even in his non-fic: It is through being patient with his undefinability that the essence shines through, for many readers. Likeliving with sculpture: you dont look at it once, then forget all about it.Anyhow, there is plenty of informational material here presented in desirable form, and the bulk of it ought not to disappoint the reader who has no use for would-be abstract/ esoteric dimensions of Borges that others may seek.I had owned the companion volume Fictions for a time, and actually found them depressing, tho worthy, and certainly 'something new.' ( attempts to read the 'Personal Anthology' in my twenties failed.) Curiously enough, I could not extract the indefinable 'something' from Borges' fiction, or his poetry I have read, that I could from the Non-fictions. The Non-fictions has more than contributed to the value of his Fictions, and enhanced and enriched them ( the reviewer on the cover of the non-fic's who says the beginner aught to start with this 'Selected Non-fic' volume, is perfectly right.)Non-fic it may be, yet one finds oneself more patient with his stately/nimble, yet mysterious prose with its abstract depth and color, than with a good deal of his fiction and poetry.I would sum it up by saying none of Borges is deserving of neglect. To own several of his volumes, and consult them at intervals over a thoughtful year's time, may be a more effective way of giving Borges 'the old college try,' than shuddering with disgust or incomprehension, and abandoning him altogether at the outset. True, this is a pricey way to do it: and repeat stories from one collection to another may seem a bad idea. Yet those in the know appreciate a variety of translations of many authors.Yet I will not say to the newcomer that Borges cannot be overall depressing. Even this volume, however, is enough to make one reach for the Prozac. Yet his non-fic offers so many returns, perhaps even over his fiction, that you will find a way to cope.Perrhaps also, it is not the subject matter overall; it is Borges style that makes this volume valuable.yet, like Mann and Auden have, I do wish there was available a few pages of Borges on Wagner! I cannot believe Borges overlooked what Mann said was such significant opera work. The inclusion of such an essay in this collection, would have immensely increased its value - tho unfortunately also its snob appeal, and perhaps the price.Non-fictions belongs on your shelf right next to Audens' 'Forewards and Afterwords,' another desirable source of intelligent presentation of a variety of subjects, not just lit. Auden will balance Borges perceived bizarre qualities for you, with a calm, encompassing intelligence.If there's a better duet of quality essays available on a variety of subjects so intelligently presented, and not essays largely devoted to the literary, I would love to know what they are. Eliot is entirely literary. Perhaps Aldous Huxley, for variety, and especially if you choose primarily to avoid American essayists.
