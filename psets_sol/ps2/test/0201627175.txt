I hesitated to buy this book because it's relatively expensive for its small size.  I'm glad I bought it because after reading it (in less than three hours), I realized it's one of the most important books I had ever read!  Feibelman gives very helpful advices for not only grad students, but also postdocs and junior faculty members.  These are advices that grad schools or even thesis mentors won't give you.  Some are obvious suggestions, but many others were totally new to me.  Among many other things, this book:1) helps you choose a thesis/postdoc lab;2) helps you decide whether to go into industry or academia;3) explains to you why it's not a good idea to start your career as an assistant professor;4) tells you when is the best time to publish your data;5) teaches you how to write good papers and to prepare for talks;6) gives you guidelines for grant writing;7) etc. etc.However, it seems to me that a few suggestions may not be applicable to biologists -- Feibelman is a physicist and thus may not be very familiar with other disciplines.  Also, he seems to have overlooked the importance of networking with other scientists, for example at conferences
