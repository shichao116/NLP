I just reread Yoganada's "Autobiography" along with this work. M., who seems to be the most referenced biographer of Ramakrishna, had a boys school in Y's old house after his family moved out. M. also brought Y to the Kali Temple at Dashineswar N of Calcutta for the first time.This biography may have been closer to the biography that Christopher Isherwood might had written if he was not working directly for the Ramakrishna Organization
