I randomly found this book while shopping in Target and started reading it immediately read it up returning home.  Never has a book hit as close to home as this one did.  While it is nice to read similar stories to mine it is kinda depressing as it reaffirms how I think other people view me.  This book is defintely a motivational tool and i thank the author was writting this book -A MUST READ for anyone who has ever stuggled with their weight
