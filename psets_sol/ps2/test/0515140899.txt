I'm one of those stubborn folk who when they start a series of books, unless it is perfectly dreadful, will grit their teeth and stay with it until it ends. Sometimes the effort is worth it, and I'll be rewarded with a book that is enjoyable and I get to escape for a few hours and learn something new. Other times, far too many times, I get disappointed and wished that I could get those wasted hours back.A recent historical series of novels, based around the six wives of King Henry VIII of England has been released. Each novel, written by a different author under the common psuedynom of "Laurien Gardner," takes on one of the unfortunate queens of this monarch. The first one was about Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain, and the second takes on her rival, Anne Boleyn. This time the actual author of the novel is Jennifer Ashely.Young Frances Pierce is a girl of seventeen when the King and his lady, Anne Boleyn, come riding through their village on royal progress. The year is 1532, and while Queen Catherine is still mighty Henry's legal wife, Anne Boleyn is able to enjoy all of the perogatives of being a 'queen,' including a magnificent household and fine trappings. Frances, knowing herself to be plain with mousy hair and no great dowry or beauty, is bedazzled by Anne's charm and dark eyes, enough that when Anne is taunted and jeered by the peasant women, Frances rushes to Anne's defense and finds herself smeared with muck.Soon, Frances is accepted into Anne Boleyn's household as a reward, fitted out with fine clothing and flirting with the gentlemen of the court. She writes her poetry, and views life as a grand and glorious game. But one courtier -- John Carlisle -- doesn't seem to take much delight in Frances being at court. He's grim and dour and seems to be underfoot when she's trying desparately to get Anne's brother, George Boleyn, to notice her.It's through Frances' eyes that we see Anne's rise to power, as she first plays the game of 'will I, won't I?' with Henry VIII, striving to hold out for a marriage proposal, and the crown. There's a secret wedding or two, a coronation, Anne's first pregnancy that resulted in a princess -- the future Elizabeth I -- and the swift downturn as Anne fails to supply that vital prince, and her eventual trial for adultery and execution. Frances, faithful and loyal, manages to find a love of her own, a stable relationship, but even that might not be enough to save her when her mistress faces the swordsman and enters into legend.Frankly, I was surprised by this novel. I was terribly disappointed by the first book of the series, finding it overwrought and badly plotted, but this one, despite the rather lifeless heroine, was better than I thought it would turn out. Gardner -- or rather Ashley -- does her research, and peoples the story with those who were actually there throughout Anne Boleyn's hectic time as queen. The only exceptions are Frances and John, along with various servants, but the four courtiers and the musician that would be executed with Anne all lived, along with other ladies who were in Anne's household. Gardner does well with staying within the known facts, except for a few glitches here and there.The only one that really made me cringe was some of the detailing on clothing, such as 'wimple' and 'veil' which would have been found in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, not the sixteenth. Anne too, gets a bit of an overhaul in this, actually being a bit kindly in her behavior towards Frances, and not the shrewish b!tch that history usually treats her as.Part of the problem with this novel is that the main character, Frances, is so passive. She's literally plucked out of obscurity to become one of Anne's attendants, flirts and plays at love, marries, and finally gets to observe Anne Boleyn's downfall at a very close range. While I do like the fact that the author did do her research and manages to weave in what did actually happen, the main character is such a milksop and not that entertaining, even when she is arguing with her one true love. Only towards the final chapter or two does Frances start showing a backbone, and while it is welcome, it's not quite enough to save this one either.Fans of the Tudor period, or historical fiction will find this one interesting. In my opinion, it's infinitely better than the bestselling The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory. Say nearly four stars for this one, as the author does try hard to get it right, and very nearly succeeds at it.Recommended
