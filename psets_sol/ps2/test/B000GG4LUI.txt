'Bound For Caanan' is an informative and moving book about the battle over slavery that took place between the founding of our country and the Civil War.  It is about a diverse, integrated, informal ever-changing organization of blacks and whites, slaves and free, male and female, religious and secular, young and old, rich and poor, educated and illiterate, with one goal in mind: "to set the captives free".  There were no official leaders, no hierarchy, no written orders, just a mission to accomplish, but the Underground Railroad worked, and worked well.Bordewiich tells us individual stories through the recorded accounts of slaves and slave owners, court records, newspaper accounts, and personal memoirs of Underground Railroad conductors.  What I like best are the detailed escape stories highlighting the remarkable heroism and commitment of the escapees and their underground helpers, as well as the stubborn determination of the pro-slavery contingent to keep their way of life intact. The stories also show the problems with the federal and state slavery-related laws in relation to differing attitudes in the South and in the North.  The problems escalated when new states were being admitted to the Union, and you can see the country coming apart at the seams as some of these stories played out near the beginning of the Civil War.The accounts are woven together very gracefully, even poetically, by the author, with an emphasis on the individual personal stories of the participants.  Also, he did not sermonize about slavery, which is so obviously wrong it needs no sermonizing.  Instead, he let the material speak for itself. It is shocking to see how bad people can become when they think they own other people, and gratifying to see how good people can become for a right cause. Even Thomas Jefferson affirmed that one of the worst spin-offs of slavery was the damage it did morally to the people who owned slaves.  (Too bad he didn't do something to stop slavery when he had the chance as president.)
