The Fugitive was Pramodya's first major novel. It takes place in Indoneisa during the final days of WW II. It is a story about war, nationalism, betrayal and not least human rationale and feelings. It tells the timeless story of a soldiers return. It combines political and social criticism with a tautly emontional narrative. It is a gripping story allowing us to peak into a contemporary Indonesia and a time that was a turning point for the Indonesia we see today. Pramodya is a truly amasing author, and his books has been a true gift in adding another tool to understand the human rationale. I am looking forward to read new books by Pramodya, who is working on a collection of the history of Indonesia at present
