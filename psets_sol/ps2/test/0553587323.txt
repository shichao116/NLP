Lord Hayden Rothwell demands that banker Timothy Longworth see him.  His cousin Alexis Welbourne insists Timothy is ill, but he has no choice but to see the visitor.  Hayden informs Timothy that he knows that the man has been extorting funds from the bank which is how his two sisters (Rose and Irene) and he live comfortably. He demands Timothy resign, leave London, and pay off his debt.  He vows not to reveal what he knows to anyone so with no choice except the gallows Timothy agrees.  Later Timothy tells his sisters and cousin that Hayden withdrew his money leaving them bankrupt.  Alexis knows she can no longer stay under his protection so she decides to find a job as either a governess or a hat maker.  She thinks Hayden is a monster as she watches her loved ones leave.Hayden gives the house to his impractical Aunt Henrietta and her daughter Caroline.  Alexis tells him he is cruel as Timothy told her he bankrupted them by removing his money.  Angry, he sticks to his pledge of revealing nothing.  Hayden offers Alexis the position of governess to Caroline; needing employment she accepts.  As she begins to become better acquainted with Hayden, she revises her opinion that he is a beast.  As she falls in love with him, Alexis realizes there is more to the bank situation than she knows and plans to learn the truth.The strong lead couple is ably supported by a delightful secondary cast especially their extended families.  The relationship between the lead couple is terrific because it changes over time as they get to know one another.  Though the displaced sisters, Rose and Irene, seem too prideful, the fast paced story line and its terrific final twist will elate Regency romance readers.Harriet Klausner
