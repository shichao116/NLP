Although I think the word Your should have been left out of the title, this book is all about the hows and whys of becoming a better discipline of Christ. Our "world" is filled with feel-good theology and illogical answers given by undisciplined but well-intentioned Christians.Which leds me to believe that apologetics are of vital importance to a Christian. Yet, we are failing. We are failing to teach this in church, in our communities and in our homes. Our culture is OUT of CONTROL and we know it, how do we change it? Feel good answers are not the answer. Walking on eggshells so as not to offend those that offend us is not the answer. Logical, solid answers about the Bible, God, Jesus are the answer. We need to not only have a heart for God, but a mind first and formost.J.P. Moreland provides a way to cultivate your mind for the glory of God; wake up and start know WHY you believe, and HOW you came to that conclusion so that you may be able to LEAD others Christ! People tend to follow others that are confident in their faith, how confident are you?Love Your God With All Your Mind is one of the books that you should read to become a spiritually mature Christian, able to lead others responsibly to the Lord
