I had a chance to read this latest Childs Tea Shop Mystery while I was cruising in the western Carribean.  Despite the numerous offerings on ship and shore, I found it hard to put this book as enticing as the author's previous efforts in this series.  Theodosia, Haley, Drayton, and even the tough, highly profession, but occasionally showing a human side, Chief Dective Burt Tidwell, were all in fine form.  In Blood Orange Brewing the reader experiences not only murder, but hidden passageways/rooms, coupled with an every building, but at first subtle, tension that comes to a dramatic culmination.  Even Theodosia's faithful dog Earl Gray gets mixed up in this caper; though no fault of his own.  What continues to appeal to me in this latest offering (I have read every Tea Mystery to date) is the Charleston, SC setting, with some real street names and towns included by the author.  This cannot help but add to the book's overall successful action and ambience.  I recommend Blood Orange Brewing to all lovers of a good, well organized, mystery.  I look forward with much anticipation to Laura Childs next tea shop offering!  And, in closing, let us not forget to mention the tasty offerings from Haley's kitchen; even while on a cruise ship they made my mouth water
