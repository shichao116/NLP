This is one great read!!!,could'nt put it down!!! Alan Alda's great bestseller is now available in paperback!!! I like it because it's thinner,lighter and more compact!!! And it's cheaper to boot!!! This book is hilarious!!! I was lucky enough to have my book signed by Alan himself!!!,he visited a Borders bookstore in the area where I live!!! Lots of information from his childhood,MASH,his films,etc!!! it also includes an afterword by Alan!!! If you are an Alan Alda fan,this book is for you!!! A treasure in my book collection!!! A treat from start to finish!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A
