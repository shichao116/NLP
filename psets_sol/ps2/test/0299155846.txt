This book makes you rethink any ideas you might have about Regionalism.   Whether you agree with James Dennis or not is up to you, but he certainly  does bring up some very interesting ideas.  The basic ideas of the  Regionalism school are initially laid out for the reader, and from this  beginning it is already possible to see the weak foundation of the very  definition of &quot;Regionalism,&quot; as it was defined NOT by the  artists, but by their critics and the public.  The sterotyping generalities  inherent in this 'school' set the stage for Dennis' questioning of the  similarities of the work of Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, and John  Steurat Curry, the triumvirate of Regionalism. The author proceeds to  explicate the inherent differences between the 3 artists' work, as well as  the eventually obvious flawed general definition of  &quot;Regionalism.&quot;   Dennis breaks down his discussions into realism  vs. abstraction, realistic subject matter vs. fantasies, the ideas of  nationalism and fascism in the artists' work, their varying depictions of  women, and finally compares the three Regionalists to three contemporary  modernists, Charles Demuth, Charles Sheeler, and Marsden Hartley. Dennis  concludes with the assertion that the so-called &quot;Regionalists&quot;  are in many ways more &quot;modern&quot; than their modernists  contemporaries. The book has plenty of pictures, sadly only in black and  white, and thus the book is a surprisingly quick read. Each chapter is  thorough however, and must be studied to be fully understood. The reader  should have some art historical background, and some knowledge of the  history of the first half of the 20th century.   I would highly recommend  this book to anyone who is interested in Regionalism, and the history of  American art.  Makes you think
