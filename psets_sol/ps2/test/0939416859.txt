This isn't a light story about a woman who decides to get even with men. There are no cute pranks, or funny tricks that the character pulls on the men around her. This is dark stuff, and I loved watching Bella spiral into a realm of curiously controlled yet out of control behavior that provided no return. Even though she's a loner verging on being an outcast, and isn't especially likeable, Bella had me rooting for her. Bella represented every woman who felt at the mercy of those around her, who wanted to rise up and take control even if it means acknowledging her dark side. This story isn't for the faint of heart, Bella chooses a pistol over pranks, it is an amazing story of how one woman hit her limit, and wasn't going to take it any more.
