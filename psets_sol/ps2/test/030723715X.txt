In talking to members of the political left about Reagan you had best not mention anything good at all, and the word 'Greatness' is likely to get them frothing at the mouth. I think that the history books will tell a somewhat different story, and this is one of the first that I've read.Presidents who enter the White House with a clearly defined and thought goal can often get that goal done. Clinton and Kennedy, to name two, came in with plans to do a lot of things. I well remember Clinton's speech where he held up a plastic card saying that this would be all that an American needed for health care. But his next speech was on a different subject, and the one after that yet another.Reagan came into office with the goal of solving the cold war. He asked for and received substantial increases in military spending, the price of getting this through congress was an incredible amount of pork barrel spending and increased social spending. Reagan said, 'OK, give me the military spending and you can have that.' By the end, Reagan had the military he needed to handle the Soviet Union and Congress had spent themselves silly.Reagan's 'Star Wars' initiative was brilliant. He proposed a defensive shield that would end the world's reliance on ICBM's. He even invited the Soviets to join in a world wide program. The Soviets  couldn't afford to either ignore or compete with 'Star Wars,' and the Cold War was over.I review this book this way because most Americans hold Churchill in high esteem, perhaps even higher than do the British themselves. And this book compares the two leaders. Perhaps you'll agree, perhaps not, but this is the way historians seem to be regarding Reagan. I think Mr. Hayward made a very good comparison and in a book that's a delight to read
