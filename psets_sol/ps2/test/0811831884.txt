Christian Americans have had marshmallow fluff and Christmas ornaments.  Jews, avoiding graven images, have evaded lots of kitsch (except for chopped liver molds). Sure, maybe you've seen Sesame Street kipahs and Nike swoosh dreidels, but what if Bezalel from the Bible and Martha Stewart mated while reading The Jewish Catalog?  Naturally, you would have the Traig sisters of the West Coast.  This book is not only fun to read, but it provides the instructions on how to create your own kitsch, like the Manischewitz Concord Grape Wine bottle lamp or the Rastafarian Hey-Mohn-Toschen.  Divided into eight parts, there are kitsch projects for everyday, Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, Sukkot, Hanukkah (burn baby Burn), Purim, Passover, and Shavuot (milk it.  do i make you flemmy, baby?).  So get up off your tucches, break your dreidel shaped piñata, grab a slice of Hava Tequila Pie, and buy this book.  Highlights include the Neil Sedaka Tzedakah Pushke Box (I used an empty band aids box); the Borscht Belt belt; a black velvet Elvis mizrach for your Eastern wall; the Carmen Miranda fruit filled yarmulke; and votive candles for Jewish patrons (the patron Jew of passive aggressive compliments).  Replace wasabi with horseradish and you have Jew-shi sushi.  Get a jar of Green olives and make some Poi Vey.  Is havdalah havdalah without the Spice girls spice box?  Is it true that there is Jewish Time?  Then make yourself the Jewish Time Zones clock.  The book closes with a Hebonics glossary.  So gather the mishpocheh, and buy the book, cuz this one is a keeper
