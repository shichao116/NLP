I really loved this book and read it entirely in one sitting. DJ is such an interesting character (and not thin, thank god!) it would be nice to see her in a possible sequel. The only criticism I would make is that the ending is a little vague. I had to read it a couple of times before I realised exactly what it was everyone was running around trying to find. Also the development of the relationship between DJ and Tom was a bit unreal. At first they hate each other, then out of the blue he declares his love for her, and in the last few pages DJ is talking marriage! I'm surprised Tom wasn't heading for the hills. It would have been nicer if there had been a bit more buildup between the two, but other than that, I'd rate &quot;Summer of the Dragon&quot; as one of Ms. Peters' best
