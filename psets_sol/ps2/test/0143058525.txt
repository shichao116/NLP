This book was recommended to me by a friend that just spent a week in Italy with me and a small group of couples.  I loved the description of a football match the main character attended in order to learn to swear in Italian. The book is full of wonderful places to smile and lots of places to understand the healing of all these magical places.  I would love to follow the footsteps of this story. I am an old hippie and I guess that is a large part of why I loved this book so much!
