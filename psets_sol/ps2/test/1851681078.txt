This is a lovely book providing excerpts from an assortment of texts.  Of course, each person might choose differently, but the translators did a very creditable job.  They included the Heart Sutra, description of the Dyanai Buddhas, & various selections which document many important principles described or assumed in contemporary books such as: egolessness-- Satasahasrika XLV f. 119: "It is because of I-making & mine-making that beings run & wander in birth & death," form--Mahaprajnaparamita, trans. Hsuan-tsang fasc. 532, ch 29 (I): "Form is nothing but holes & cracks,"  magical illusion-- Sikshasamuccaya 233-4 (Ratnakuta & Ratnacuda): "Thought is like a magical illusion...thought cannot review thought.  As the blade of a sword cannot cut itself, as a finger-tip cannot touch itself, so a thought cannot see itself," duality--Satasahasrika LII, f. 279-83: "all dharmas are baseless...where there is duality, there is a basis," & luminosity-- Satasahasrika III, 495-502: "original nature is a state of transparent luminosity."  They also include more unusual material such as some Yogacara works, a different view of the time-existence of the Buddha--Saddharmapundarika XV, 268-72: Although the Tathagata has not entered Nirvana, he makes a show of entering Nirvana, for the sake of those who have to be educated...aeons must elapse before my life-span is complete," & the remarkable Saraha, Dohakosha (Saraha's Treasury of Songs) which dismisses many still-prevalent Buddhist activities-- 13-5 "Will one gain release, abiding in meditation?  What's the use of lamps?  What's the use of offerings?  What's to be done by reliance on mantras?  Abandon such false attachments & renounce such illusion! ...Without meditating, without renouncing the world, One may stay at home in the company of one's wife.  Can that be called perfect knowledge, Saraha says, If one is not released while enjoying the pleasures of sense?"  In addition, David Snellgrove provides an excellent analysis of the Vimilakirti Sutra: "The fault in this plot is that it makes us expect too much from Vimalakirti's argumentative power...the actual quality of his discourse is not good enough.  We are left wondering why all the Saints stood in such awe of him.  The author of this sutra tries to make up for this defect by a series of flighty miraculous episodes, which serve only to enhance the general effect of triviality."  Overall, the editors provide a fine, balanced overview of Buddhist literature & its development over the centuries
