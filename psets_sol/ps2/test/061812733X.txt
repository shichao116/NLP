I read this book without reading any reviews ahead of time so I had no idea what to expect, except that it was a first novel. Our Monday daily reccomends 4 paperbacks each week and they are quite diverse and usually pretty good (at least the few I pick out). It's funny now reading all the reviews at 3:13 am how many references to John Irving there are. I thought exactly the same reading this work the last 2 days. It was a joy to read and I'd say that if she improves the way our friend Mr Irving did after his 1st couple books, this author's Garp may be very close. I hope so. I need some new good authors. Great characters here. Keep 'em coming Elizabet
