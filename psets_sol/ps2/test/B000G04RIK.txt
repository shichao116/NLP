I just bought Mary Mary last week, my first book I have read by James Patterson and could hardly put it down.I bought 2 more( Alex Cross series) and read both within a week. Now today I just bought 2 more( Jack and Jill and Cat and Mouse and I am anxious to start them. They are all very scary and very hard to put down. I see Mr Patterson has written alot of books, should keep me busy for awhile
