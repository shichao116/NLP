While there is so much of Calvin's theology I find reprehensible and even offensive (i.e. his ideas about eternal damnation and his obsession with the work of Satan in many parts of his works) he remains in my view, the most brilliant Christian theologian the Protestant tradition has produced.   As well as basically living and breathing the Bible and having an encylopedic knowledge of classical literature and the Church fathers, he is also brilliantly original in his conceptions of theology, of God, of the nature of Christ, and is able to deftly interpret sacred scripture at multiple levels with seemingly effortless ease.These strengths are combined with a graceful style and an elegant organisation of his ideas and argument, and the Institutes is framed with a beautifully unpretentious preface and each chapter is set out like a brilliantly crafted rhetorical speech by an orator or an appeal by a top lawyer (Calvin's background was in Law).The Institutes are best read in conjunction with his commentaries on the Bible, which while incomplete and very long, have such a depth combined with such a grace of expression and style Christians of all backgrounds will read them with pleasure.  I only wish evangelical Christianity and indeed Protestant Christianity had more such minds around today, given the often insipid and uninspiring commentaries on the Bible which abound today.Many of Calvin's arguments will no longer hold water, given what is now known about the Bible and its circumstances of composition.  Calvin asserts for example the Old Testament is written by Moses and the canon of scripture was not determined by the Church but handed down by God (which historical study indicates the reverse is the case).  Calvin is also often very violent, like Luther, towards his theological opponents, describing them as agents of the devil and the anti-Christ.  He also presided over the burning of a heretic, Michael Servetus, which further darkens the biography of this otherwise brilliant man.Despite these flaws, Calvin is a brilliant thinker and writer, in my view on the same level as Augustine.  Despite forwarding some theological positions many today would find reprehensible (such as the damnation of those who don't know Christ to hell by God's predestination, an idea which helped make Darwin an agnostic) the Institutes is more or less a complete Summa of Protestantism, and Protestant Christianity and its offshoots (such as evangelicalism and fundamentalism) would not be comprehensible without reading the Institutes.  Calvin also goes to great length in the Institutes to emphasize God's wisdom in the created universe and also in created man; his refreshingly positive view no doubt (as Alister McGrath argued) helped science take off in many Protestant countries, such as Germany and England, and which puts paid to some of the excessively negative views of the universe which crop up in religions.  He is also an able and brilliant Biblical expositor and commentator, and remains an important influence on Protestant theology, with brilliant thinkers like Karl Barth and Alister McGrath finding much insight in his theology.Still, despite his brilliance, Calvin's offshoot, Calvinism, in my view has not been a good influence on the Christian tradition.  While there is and was much merit in his arguments, his emphasis on hell and damnation for unbelievers, election and predestination, reading the Bible in a way which suspends historical criticism, and above all Calvinism's offshoots in the formation of Protestant Fundamentalism, as well as his neglect of the mystical side of Christianity, have in the 20th century done a great deal of damage to the intellectual and moral respectability of Christianity.  Even Calvin's emphasis on the 'argument from design' to prove God's existence later proved to be a critical weak point, being demolished and even ridiculed by thinkers like David Hume, and of course the discovery of evolution and the great age of the Earth make arguments about an absolutely providential God controlling all things to bring about a greater good which now seems to take billions of years and involves so much suffering and waste quite hard to defend against atheistic criticism , and atheists like Richard Dawkins have made quite a mockery of the argument from design framed by Protestants such as William Paley (who no doubt believed in the invisible wisdom of God being expressed in created things), as well as the rather sad attempts to resurrect it (such as fundamentalists who emphasize the Earth is 6,000 years old), attempts Calvin himself may have backed well off from endorsing.Would Calvin if he were alive today, argue all Buddhists, Hindus and those who existed before Biblical times (approx 100 billion humans) are now all roasting in hell for not knowing Christ?  I don't know.However, Calvin is a figure still well worth studying because his thoughts continue to deeply influence all areas of Christian theology and indeed, Christianity itself, and his words of assurance of salvation given faith in Christ despite man's seeming helplessness to save himself from evil, remain warm consolation for many millions of Protestants across the world today
