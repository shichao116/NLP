Although a book written many years ago, I was recently drawn [8/2000] to  finally read it.  The history that was delineated in this book parallels my  own personal experiences especially that regarding the Iroquois  Confederacy.  Two years ago I returned a sacred pipe to the  Canadian/American area where the history of this book takes place.  The  information I personally garnered during this mission of &quot;return&quot;  is the same as described in the book.  Although written in 1988, it speaks  of this &quot;NOW&quot; that we are presently experiencing. I personally  feel the accuracy of this book is fairly high and should be recommended  reading for all on the path of returning Humanity and Mother Earth to the  Oneness
