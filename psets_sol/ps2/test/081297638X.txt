Katha Pollitt remains one of the great, largely undiscovered resources of wisdom with teeth in this country.  Rank her with Molly Ivins and Barbara Ehrenreich! (Now there's a triumvirate that could straighten the moral spine of this materialistic marsh of a country.)  Pollitt's introduction to "Virginity or Death!" is, as "they" say, worth the price of the book.  She mentions with pride that Bernard Goldberg has positioned her in the 74th spot in his "100 People Who Are Screwing Up America" and adds: "(Memo to self: must try harder.)" Buy and read this book.  It will help you to clearly see who is really trying and who is truly screwing America
