I had been a bit disappointed by the last couple of Tony Hillerman's books. This one was much more like the 'old' Hillerman. I am enchanted by how Hillerman moves Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn along the road of life, gives interesting insight into Navajo and Hopi culture, and still presents good solid mysteries. Hillerman is an outstanding writer with a relaxed and easy style. Like all of the earlier Chee/Leaphorn novels this one leaves you a bit breathless and with a smile on your face. Really good stuff.Why the four stars instead of five? Well, the resolution of the mystery was a bit abrupt. Hillerman could have written an entire chapter to take up the loose ends, but he elected to do so in a couple of paragraphs. It left me feeling a bit left out, that's all
