The first chapter may seem bland, but they are well written and very intelligent. The explaination of subculture vs. lifestyle or tribal is informative and supported quite well. Well researched and impressive book. But keep in mind this data is taken from Goths from England, not the US, so some might not be able to follow in the interveiws.
