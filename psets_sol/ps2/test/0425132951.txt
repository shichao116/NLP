This is another incredible book by Koontz which I found very difficult to put down.The story revolves around Susan Thorton, waking in a hospital bed after a car accident, having been in a coma and suffering now from amnesia. The terror starts when she slowly encounters dead men from a horrifying incident 13 years earlier.Each time Susan feels like she's starting to understand things, the rug gets pulled out from under her feet, and you're right there with her, baffled at each new turn, and feeling her terror with each encounter with the dead men. As she slowly questions whether she's slipping over the edge into insanity, you also question her sanity, and what is real and what is illusion.Koontz's prose is excellent, truly putting us inside of Susan's head, making you wonder how YOU would react if put in the same situation.An excellent read and a definite recommendation
