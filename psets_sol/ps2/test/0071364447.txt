I have followed Bruce's career for over 30 years.  In that time he has changed from a naval architect who sells hand-drawn boat plans to a designer using the most sophisticated technology to produce first rate boat plans and kits for the perceptive buyer.  This revision of Metal Boats has built on that excellent work and explores all current knowledge about steel, aluminum and copper-nickel boatbuilding.  I think that the book lives up to Bruce's promise to &quot;turn a welder into a boatbuilder.&quot
