This book is a college-level text that explains and documents XINU, a compact, robust operating system.  The code for every function appears in the book embedded in explanatory text.  The author exposes his design choices and the reasons behind them.  Exercises encourage thinking about alternative methods and added features.  I used XINU for a very demanding real-time system.  I found it to be capable and robust.  The superb documentation found in the book gave confidence to write several device drivers for some peculiar peripherals.  This the best of the dozen or so books on operating systems that I've read
