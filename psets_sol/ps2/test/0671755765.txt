This is an excellent book although as one reviewer noted, Reagan is not given proper credit for ending the Cold War. But whether you like or hate Reagan, you will enjoy this book. It gives a concise and excellent account of Iran-Contra. This book is worth it for no other reason than those two chapters. You find out how devious Reagan's subordinates were and the fact that he tolerated an environment that enabled I-C to happen.But Reagan shines in many places, too. He shines when firing the striking PATCO workers in 1981 as well as when he got Prime Minister Begin to stop bombing Beirut in 1982.There are a few mis-steps that prevent me from giving it five stars, however. First, Reagan's illnesses are only mentioned in passing - with the exception of his cancer surgery that marked the beginning of Iran-Contra. Nothing is said about Nancy's breast cancer and very little about the strained relationship between Ronnie and his kids.Part of the reason for this is because the author, Lou Cannon, wrote two other books about Reagan before this one. This one deals primarily with Reagan as President. The first two dealt with his time as governor and his election in 1980.All in all, it is a good read, just a little short of the five star mark. Read both this book and "Reagan," also by Cannon, and you get a greater understanding of what made Reagan tick.
